I can‚Äôt believe that a mother could do such things to her own children. Story was well done, but I did have to re-listen a few times to understand who or what was being talked about.', 'Good investigation, good to listen to all at once or you might forget the names and who they are. I didn‚Äôt like the host, I wish the host was less patronizing.', 'This story is just so sad. Those poor children. I like that it includes Colby too! I‚Äôm so sorry to Kay & Larry too.', 'Audio quality isn‚Äôt very good and the story has been covered many times in better detail and better quality before. LISK was much better and much more authentic.', 'This podcast is trash, it‚Äôll do in a pinch, but the way the story is framed and told is so unnecessarily salacious. Dateline is always gonna be cheesy af but this dudes narration and interview style is soooo unbearable and gross. \n\n If you want a really good book/audio about fundamentalist LDS, the history of fundamentalism and murder read John Krakaur‚Äôs book Under the Banner of Heaven.', 'Love the pacing and how the story is being told! Absolutely captivating!!', 'This is to the lady who wrote the message above, and clearly this new cult of the 144 thousand is located somewhere in the ‚Äúscripture‚Äù of the Book of Mormon. Not saying Mormons arnt great people, I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs a cult by almost every definition. And this new cult was born from Mormonism. Lastly I thought he did a pretty great job differentiating the difference between these crazy people and normal LDS family‚Äôs.', 'I love Dateline, so jumped when I heard they had a podcast. Keith is a mesmerizing storyteller.', 'Narrator does a great job, he just doesn‚Äôt fit with the terrible story he‚Äôs telling. Sounds like he‚Äôs from The Haunted Mansion ride.', 'I followed this in the news but the in depth story is more crazy than I could have imagined (and sad) But why doesn‚Äôt Melanie ever ask lori where jj is!?!?', 'I grew up LDS and then critical thinking happened and never looked back. The LDS religion mixed with major mental health problems does not go well. Keith does an amazing job of pointing out the obvious crazy thinking and I love it!', 'Love Keith‚Äôs voice, but the nudge-nudge-wink-wink delivery is unsettling in a story with so many deaths.', 'For a true crime enthusiast who has followed this case from the beginning, I love this narration! Although the information is not ‚Äúnew‚Äù, it‚Äôs a good refresher for those who have followed the case or are just learning of it. To those complaining of the narrators voice and the way he speaks of the story ‚Äì LOL! You must be new to the Dateline/true crime world because anyone who has listened to Keith Morrison over the years understands his craft! He is a true crime legend and I would be disappointed if this were narrated by anyone else.', 'Anything Keith Morrison has his hands on, turns to gold.', 'It‚Äôs compelling. There‚Äôs so much good true crime, this feels more old school. So old school the narrator sounds like the snowman from Rudolph the Red Nosed reindeer. You expect him to slide into a chuckle at any moment.', 'I was hesitant to listen because I thought dateline had covered everything already, but I was wrong this is SO GOOD. Go ahead and listen already.', 'The stars I‚Äôm giving are only for the investigative work and writing. It‚Äôs very interesting as a criminal case, but the way it‚Äôs told has hints of judgmental tones? and this is regarding people who know the suspect, or victims themselves. If someone does something or trusts someone, the host projects this horrible patronizing tone over the story. Even sometimes when he interviews people he‚Äôs condescending and rude. There‚Äôs a way to be objective, get the truth and tell the truth, but not with this way of framing.', 'You have to listen to this all at once or you‚Äôll forget a lot of what happened', 'I binged all of this today and the 5th episode home boy does not play when he‚Äôs asking the couple their questions üòÇüòÇüòÇ Hilarious, I wish I could‚Äôve watched that interview üò≠', 'He‚Äôs a great story teller but there is no new information here. He keeps acting like these are new facts and each episode ends as if it‚Äôs a cliff hanger. We all know what happened to these poor kids. Too bad they waited so long to put this out. At this time it isn‚Äôt worth listening to.', 'Very well done.  In-depth investigation told in a compelling, riveting way.  Love Keith‚Äôs voice and narrative style.', 'This story is even weirder and wilder than I thought it would be. I‚Äôm not allowing myself to google the ending. So can you please come out with episodes faster or more consistently? Im going crazy here!!', 'It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve been so excited for the next episode of a podcast, great job Keith! You are an excellent host!', 'You‚Äôre actually ..... right. \n\nThe narration is tone deaf and actually feels disrespectful at times. And why SO scripted? Narrator would have been better off shooting from the hip with an outline of general talking points. This style of narration honestly only works with fictional stories for children. Or certain advertisements. And if that was the case this would honestly be some of the best voiceover work I‚Äôve ever heard.\n\nKeith, if you insist on doing factual stories about human tragedy, put away the cheery clown mask and just be yourself. YOU CAN DO IT! HATERS WOULD BE SILENCED!', 'This narration is completely insufferable. The snarky tone and snappy interjections ‚Äî he‚Äôs cracking actual jokes in a story about a mother MURDERING HER CHILDREN.  I‚Äôm disgusted by the choices made here and everyone involved should be ashamed.', 'This had nothing to do with a normal or an average Mormon family. This was a cult not a religion. Shame on Dateline for continuing to mention the LDS without explaining the differences.', 'I love this pod! The narrator is wonderful. Not only is his voice soothing but he makes it easy to follow the story. Well done.', 'It‚Äôs brutal to hear him telling the story of death and disaster in his kid-story-book tones and inflections.', 'I appreciate many true crime podcasts. There are many ways to relate a story and I seldom judge stringently. Everyone has their own voice. This particular voice however revels in nasty. I listened to three episodes because the story is so compelling and unusual and I wanted to hear the original voices share their stories. I unsubscribed however because the narration was simply vile. I will never listen to a podcast from this journalist again. The story may be accurate, but the reporting is foul.', 'I love anything Keith Morrison narrates.', 'Such a smug, arrogant, patronizing host. Couldn‚Äôt take it any longer. These are child murderers he‚Äôs talking about, yet he mocks it like it‚Äôs some joke. What an elitist tool.', 'I love Keith. He does such a great job! This podcast is heartbreaking. There were so many opportunities to stop these two psychopaths. Ugh!', 'Keith‚Äôs voice narrating the facts is haunting. So terribly sad of the reality of this story. Wish I wasn‚Äôt hoping to get to the next episode.', 'This podcast is a really good story! Also a super big fan of Keith Morrison!!', 'I‚Äôm glad y‚Äôall put this in-depth report into a podcast. More ears on this story is a good thing.', 'I love this, such great detail.  I wish I knew the schedule for future episodes, it would save me from always looking for the next one.', 'Anything Keith Morrison!!!! I‚Äôm in it! Best Narrator ever! This lady is scary evil! Supervillain.. Feb 16 is my birthday ü•≥', 'Can hardly wait until the next episode drops.  Such a fascinating and tragic story.', 'Keith Morrison‚Äôs narration is excellent, setting a perfect tone for this podcast about a bizarre and tragic story. The interviews are compelling and very moving.', 'It is unm idk don‚Äôt even have a supsrcoption', 'Love this podcast!! Keith is so good!! Can‚Äôt wait for episode 5!!!', 'Those AZ cops are the worst.', 'I really want to like the podcast, the story is very interesting. I can‚Äôt seem to be able to enjoy it. The story line seems all over the place. Skipping over, or missing entirely, important details. In the whole 40 minute episode I‚Äôm basically left with one or two facts added to the story. In the entire 40 minutes?! Every time an episode ends, I think to myself, ‚Äúthat was it?.. did I miss something?‚Äù. I even replayed an episode thinking maybe I wasn‚Äôt paying attention.There‚Äôs so much more detail that could have been added in. I, of course, will still listen through, as I question my sanity.', 'Title for a Podcast Ever!!   None of this is new information.  Dateline and Lester maybe just take. Back seat.', 'Loved Every Minute so far! Keith Morrison is a treasure, a true wordsmith. Can‚Äôt wait to hear how the story ends, hopefully with a prison sentence.', 'Keith Morrison‚Äôs storytelling is next level. Hoping there are other Dateline podcasts he narrates. If not, I‚Äôd happily listen to him read the phone book.', 'I have loved Keith Morrison forever and I love love love how he talks about this this has been a case of my family‚Äòs been interested in for a long time since we heard about it we‚Äôve been interested in it. I listen to the dateline podcast for the specific story I also listened to crime junkies and I think small-town murder might‚Äôve done a podcast on the story as well and I have listen to all of them so thank you for putting out a podcast solely about this case!', 'So much more info about the case then you‚Äôve previously seen. I‚Äôm literally talking to my self at work listening to this podcast... ‚Äúno freaking way...,you‚Äôre kidding me!!!, oh my god.‚Äù It‚Äôs one of those. Also bottle Keith‚Äôs voice and sell it because my lord I swear I could listen to him read the dictionary.', 'I am already really into this story. As far as true crime stories go you can‚Äôt beat the old school dateline.', 'keith morrison is a king. i‚Äôd listen to anything he narrates and give it 100% good ratings. \nthe end.']"

Me too!\n\nThe constant gasping to every detail is obnoxious and feels incredibly disrespectful to the victims/families.  You already know the story and details so inserting the gasping is fake and contrived.   Why fake it?  To hype up an already horrific detail to the listener?  Show some respect and lament.  If the victims mother was standing in front of you telling her story, would you childishly gasp your way through her details?  \n\nEver drive in a car & the passenger gasps super loud?  As the driver your heart skips a beat thinking something horrible happened.  Passenger only saw a cute dog.  Driver thinks what an A Hole to do that while I‚Äôm driving.  That‚Äôs Britt‚Äôs gasping here.  Unnecessary and A hole to do in the middle of Ashley‚Äôs story telling.', 'I just found this podcast three days ago, and I cannot get enough of it!

I loved it so much more in the earlier shows because it was straight to the point with the story now there‚Äôs so much more extra context. So hard to find people who keep it original from day one. \n\n10/10 recommend starting from the episodes in 2018.', 'Im new to podcastsüòÅ someone recommended I listen to you guys.

But for some reason I CANNOT get into the new episodes üòû Like I want to, and then I‚Äôm 40 minutes in and realize I haven‚Äôt been paying attention. Is it just me!? Did something change?

Ashley and Brit have an amazing way of telling stories, and have done so many I had never heard of. I have listened to every episode multiple times, and will continue to do so.

Always informative but also quick to point out that sometimes mistakes happen and also quick to point out injustices btw race and personal choices made that shouldn‚Äôt matter and police should do the work regardless of race, income or sexual preference. Thank you!', 'First, let me preface this by saying I love this podcast.  It‚Äôs my top crime podcast.  However, the ‚Äú wait, what‚Äù by Brit makes my head boil. The fake questions and dialogue between both hosts is an authentic and the listener can sense it.  It‚Äôs the bad acting for me', 'The fact driven storytelling is great, but man, the gasps of surprise and other examples of forced back and forth banter is really exhausting for me personally. You are friends 4eva, we get it.', 'You probably will never see this but ya‚Äôll are the best. My sister left home a few days ago and she loved your podcast. I haven‚Äôt talked to her since she left but when I listen to this podcast while I do my chores I find myself crying after turning to ask my sister if she has listened to the episode I am on only to realize I never will have that again. I miss her and ya‚Äôll have helped me cope with losing her as my partner in crime. The relationship you have with each other reminds me of my sister and I. I am sure I was going somewhere with this.... Oh yeah thanks for being a light in the darkness even though you tell gruesome stories. \n\nPS If you see this (which you probably won‚Äôt) can you give us an update on Madeline McCann?', 'You can‚Äôt! You both are truly amazing. The facts you gather just to tell these peoples stories! Both your voices bring a settling theme to this podcast, that adds a calming mystery vibe. I‚Äôve become obsessed with each and every case. I‚Äôve ended some cases bawling my eyes out and some have left my stomach in knots with the disturbing details. But this is real and this is life, and I‚Äôve learned so much with our crime junkie rules. \nAnd to think my obsession all started while I was talking to my hair dresser, and within a quality hair sesh I was addicted. \n\nThanks again!', 'Was obsessed for so long but the last couple times I‚Äôve listened it seems like it‚Äôs on fast forward. I even played with the speed of the podcast app and it‚Äôs not that but the way it‚Äôs recorded/edited.

Y‚Äôall have such great voices! They‚Äôre pleasant to the ear and they go so well with your show \n2. Y‚Äôall never really go off track. Everything is about the crime in the episode and you do your best to explain all you know about it \n3. Honestly, the music is so good. It just goes great with the show and it‚Äôs so upbeat but also a little suspenseful', 'The Best!', 'Driving back and forth from work 45 mins each way (sometimes longer depending on weather) this really helps get me through. I‚Äôm hooked. I started with 2020 episodes. And decided to go all the way back to the start, and continue from there. Love this podcast!', 'Absolutely no empathy. Sad.', 'this is the first podcast i was actually able to listen to without giving up after one episode, i absolutely love brit and ashley they are fantastic story tellers and they each add their own perspective! i highly recommend this to anyone who‚Äôs obsessed with true crime', 'Love the pod so much. I started listening because I got tired of my music playlists lol. Best decision ever!', 'I just came on here to leave my 5 stars because I can‚Äôt believe some of the nasty comments in some of the other ones!\nI think some of them must be left by the competition. Except maybe the jerk who called them ‚Äúman-bashers‚Äù. Really? Maybe you‚Äôre just a psycho dude! 96% of murders are committed by men..... but whatever.\nI‚Äôm enjoying this podcast.

Makes it hard to take the podcast seriously. All the fake responses by Brit are cringey. Also why is everything ‚Äúsuper‚Äù according to Ashley? For example, ‚Äúthe guy was SUPER drunk‚Äù or ‚Äúthe evidence isn‚Äôt SUPER compelling‚Äù etc. Gets old and is ridiculous. Not to mention how they are giggling while discussing gruesome murders yet crying over dog shelter stories. I just learned about the plagiarism, which is disappointing.

This podcast is one big ego trip for them and I think it‚Äôs about time they either make some major changes or end it.

It is contagious.\nI have been blessed to find both Mother Angelica and St. Padre Pio on my path to growing closer to God.

I often listen while doing something else, like making coffee or folding laundry, but this helps me to stick with it. Though I‚Äôm not catching every detail, it‚Äôs been amazing to start to see the full picture of the story of Scripture. I know this is laying the groundwork for a lifetime of more detailed scripture study.', 'Before 2021 I had never heard of Father Mike.   I was looking for a Bible review podcast.   I was reading and noticed a Catholic priest was reading the Bible for a year (Father Mike).  I hate to say it, but I imagined a boring, highly intellectual old guy reading from the holy book and I thought twice about listening.   I‚Äôm glad I listened to this podcast.   Father Mike is a breath of fresh air to the Catholic faith.   He has a down to Earth personality and truly is excited about his path in life.   I did further research on the Father and learned he has been around for a while teaching many subjects within the church.   I am truly blessed the Holy Spirit has placed Father Mike in my path.   The father teaming up with Ascension is truly a good thing.  The Bible is now easier to understand.  God bless you!', 'God Bless you Fr. Mike and always keep you happy healthy strong..

Mike‚Äôs voice as he leads us through stories of brokenness and of love. I forgot how much I love being read to, although I am reading along as well. Thank you, thank you! I look forward to each day‚Äôs podcast. By year‚Äôs end, I hope to cross another item off my bucket list...', 'What a gift to have the intelligence of Fr. Mike read and explain the Lords word. Too many times I‚Äôve planned on reading the Bible but could never get into it and questioned what I was reading, what it meant. It seemed too monumental of a task. I‚Äôm so glad this life changing opportunity came along - thank you Fr. Mike!', 'This is such a needed gift for us all this year. Thank you sincerely for your hard work in this. I enjoy every moment of the podcast and love how Fr. Mike‚Äôs commentary makes it feel relevant to life today as well as fills in gaps and questions I may have had while listening.', 'I‚Äôve belonged to more bible studies than I can count.   In all of them we individually read and study and then discuss like in a book club.  Rarely does anyone READ you the Bible out load from cover to cover.   Yes we hear scripture in Church but these Scriptures are soooo logically organized in this format feel like I am hearing a wonderful story!   ( I am).   The prayers are relevant and the commentary is focused.  \nAnd this Book Club is huge with so many FB study groups sharing in the Journey.', 'I‚Äôve always wanted to read the Bible but never knew how to go about it. Fr. Mike and Ascension have made this the best experience possible!

I recommend this podcast to everyone. It‚Äôs the best way to know and love God‚Äôs word!', 'My husband and I are doing this Bible study in a year journey together. It has been such a blessing beyond words to take in God‚Äôs holy word and the commentary and in depth study with Father Mike. God has spoken to our hearts through and through. I can not even begin to explain how many times a reading and discussion has been a WOW moment, and turns into a Thank you God for giving us Your holy word moment.

I am Catholic, he is not.  We have the Great Adventure Bible and follow word for word.  We are learning so much and can‚Äôt wait to listen every day.  We love Father Mike‚Äôs enthusiasm and passion!  Thank you!', 'My wife and I made the decision to ‚Äòtry‚Äô\nspend time together early in our day, each day to listen to Fr Mike‚Äôs Bible in a year. We talked about how difficult it will be. You know what, we are 60 days into it and it‚Äôs working. Somehow it‚Äôs worked out. It‚Äôs happening! Brings deeper personal meaning to our library, the books of Bible and the word of God. It‚Äôs like spoon feeding a baby a little bit at a time. What a blessing. Yes, we are growing spiritually no question. \nFr Mike, thank you for taking the time to put this together. With us knowing you, watching you continue to grow as a Priest in our Diocese and listening to God‚Äôs word thru your voice makes this really special. \nThank you!', 'This changed my life and has helped me to love the Lord more deeply and see all that he has given me, both the roses and the thorns!! Thank you Fr. Mike and all who made this podcast possible!!!!!!', 'I‚Äôve tried to read the Bible cover to cover several times and I‚Äôve never made it all the way through (Leviticus, am I right?). Now, as a new mom with a baby, finding time to read and study Scripture is harder than ever. Enter the Bible in a Year podcast. I love this show because I can listen to it while my hands are busy. Fr. Mike‚Äôs short commentary at the end helps me make sense of what I heard. Because let‚Äôs be honest, sometimes the Bible is a little confusing! It‚Äôs not super rigorous and academic, just a little nugget of info or insight to help you really get something out of the day‚Äôs reading. I‚Äôm so thankful I have this podcast to give me a good dose of Scripture when I can‚Äôt find the time to sit down and actually read the words myself. Thanks Fr. Mike!', 'What a blessing.  Thank you Fr Mike.', 'I‚Äôm not trying to mess up his humbleness, but Fr. Mike is my favorite priest/person! I can certainly understand why he was chosen for this podcast. I am learning so much and eagerly look forward to each new day of Bible study.  Fr. Mike explains things so easily that everyone can understand. He makes me want to increase my knowledge and live a better life. I want to shout praises for the podcast from the rooftops! I am praying for Fr. Mike and all of my fellow participants every day.', 'Thanks father Mike ! God is blessing us through you!', 'I don‚Äôt know how to describe how much of a blessing this Bible in a year podcast has been in my life. I‚Äôve tried to read the Bible before, but I‚Äôd always lose motivation because there was so many things I didn‚Äôt understand or would misunderstand. It has helped so much having Fr. Mike explain the readings. I haven‚Äôt missed a day yet, and always look forward to hearing the word of God everyday now. Hearing Fr. Mike say he can‚Äôt wait to be with us again tomorrow brings so much joy to my heart. I feel as if our Heavenly Father is saying that to me.', 'This has been a comfort to look forward to each day. I have been inspired by all of the teachings and have learned more in these past 60 days then when I had attended CCD, or my Catholic HS and college. Thank you Fr Mike for this tremendous gift, I am praying for you and this community.', 'Highly recommend to both people inexperienced with God‚Äôs word as well as people who have been reading the Bible for a while. God Bless you Father Mike!', 'This is exactly what society needs right now and it is so refreshing to see it catch on. If the schools won‚Äôt educate our children properly we‚Äôll take matters into our own hands. Thanks for this Fr. Mike!', ""I have tried to read the Bible many times and have a difficult time. Bible in a Year podcast with Father Mike has made it possible. It's part of my mornings now and I am very grateful!!"", 'Reading the Bible in this way is really blessing my soul. Finally I am getting some understanding of and spending time the word. Every day there is increase in wisdom and understanding.', 'I have never read the Bible with such detail, and I gather most people will say the same.  This is an awesome opportunity.  If we have questions would you be able to insert a podcast episode every 50 or so weeks to address them just in case we want to understand more, but not necessary to the daily Bible in a Year in case we miss it?  Or add our questions in with your podcast talks with Jeff Cavins? Like what are all of these wave offerings? And all of the different reasons for each offering? I love your explanations & how you make it real & relevant in today‚Äôs world. May God bless you and our whole Community that has been formed to learn God‚Äôs word.', 'I really enjoy the readings of Father Mike.  He makes it easy to listen to and I always learn something each time. I love how he translates the readings into our everyday life meanings. Thank you for doing such a wonderful thing for all of us!', 'Approachable, invigorating, and full of love! This podcast is changing my life and is making me extremely excited to continue learning about the Bible!', 'Thankful to be on this journey with so many others... walking together with our God!', 'Fr Mike, know that I pray for you everyday.  Your daily narration and discussion of Gods word has become the most peaceful and meaningful time of my day.  I honestly am sad to think about the year being over and we will be through the Bible.  It‚Äôs been like a friend helping us know and find God.\nThank you and may God bless you always.', 'This is life-changing. Would 100 percent recommend for anyone!', 'I absolutely love this podcast! So easy & relaxing to listen to. Father Mike is so always reassuring that it‚Äôs okay if you accidentally miss a day(s) which to me is so comforting because sometimes life gets busy and I do accidentally miss a day. I‚Äôm always happy to come back and catch up. Listening to this podcast always makes me feel happy and helps me destress. Thank you father Mike. God Bless You! I am praying for you', 'I am loving hearing God‚Äôs word proclaimed through Fr. Mike.  I have read the Bible before, but I have never gained the wisdom and understanding as I am now, hearing it through the lens of father Mike.  Fr. Mike is easy to listen to and his explanations after each days readings are invaluable! I am so thankful that my girlfriend Annie shared this podcast with me.  I can already feel that 2021 is going to be a better spiritual year for me having experienced the Bible with Fr. Mike.', 'Father Mike, I hate to admitted but the truth is I have never read the Old Testament until now.  Every time I attempted to do it, I would give up because I couldn‚Äôt understand it. Thank you father for helping me and others and making not just easy to understand but so enjoyable to listen to you. God bless you!', 'Awesome podcast and worth every minute!

And the last star is lost due to his ignorance. If you don‚Äôt you think I‚Äôm wrong and Ben is actually a really smart guy. Look up Ben Shapiro Aquaman.', 'If you‚Äôre on the fence, listen to The Economist interview with Anne McElvoy. It‚Äôs eye-opening and a few of Ben‚Äôs answers surprised me. Anne is tough on Ben, but not in a bad ad hominem way. She is a fair intellectual that really got to the heart of Ben that people can judge for themselves. \n\nBen is the best! I‚Äôm not a republican, but I really love Ben‚Äôs commentary and point of view. I take in all sides, but Ben‚Äôs is the most rational and funny.\n\nYes, I know he‚Äôs right-sided, and I respect his beliefs. Politics and news today are warped. We need people like Ben to tell it like it is. (Plus his impersonations of Trump and Bernie are hilarious‚Äînot so much the others.) \n\nSometimes he is vicious like a pit bull, and I have to give him a break. But that‚Äôs why his mellow Sunday Special episodes are so refreshing. (Check out Kennedy, Nikki Haley, Scott Adams, Yang, Kirk Cameron: all of them.) Plus, I like to take in Michael Knowles‚Äô podcast when I need a more jovial‚Äîbut equally provocative‚Äîtake on the news. \n\nTo all the critics, if you‚Äôre not conservative or open-minded, no need to proclaim your dissent. This is not for you, turn the other cheek and keep looking. Most news outlets have some degree of bias. Ben‚Äôs bias is usually substantiated, intelligent, moral, and entertaining. Sit back and enjoy. \n\nBtw, I‚Äôm a Daily Wire subscriber. It‚Äôs so worth it‚Äîand so are his books. The DW app is genius too, I wish I had 3 hours to take each day‚Äôs podcast in.

He forces me to think more deeply about the things I don‚Äôt agree with him on because he gives a reasoned viewpoint instead of just spouting party line rhetoric. Additionally, he‚Äôs starting to lay out positive ways to counter the cancel culture which is destroying individuals and will ultimately take down the country if we don‚Äôt start pushing back against it!', 'I don‚Äôt understand why someone that has never done anything interesting other than complain has such a big audience. He‚Äôs the prime example of white male privilege, that had everything handed to him and failed at every step in his professional career. He‚Äôs like an eloquent alex Jones', 'I listen to better understand my friends and family that listen to Mr. Shapiro. As someone who tends to fall a little left of center, it makes sense that I agree with him about half the time. He has provided information that I have not heard before as well as insight to the positions my loved ones share with him. What exhausts me is the aggressive tone with which the message is delivered. And as I recall debates in my own household with those who are also strongly conservative, I have had to weather the storm of that aggression. To that point, for the sake of relationships, politics just can‚Äôt be discussed. He makes fun of leftist tears, but I have to say the anger of the far right, that I can‚Äôt help but hear when I listen to this podcast, seems much more troublesome. I listen to other conservative as well, so I know that the anger doesn‚Äôt permeate the entire right. What I wonder is if Mr. Shapiro enhances his podcast with a little extra aggression to appeal to those who feed off it. I plan to continue to listen for the insight and, honestly, he can occasionally be quite humorous, but I do feel a little beat up once I‚Äôm done.', 'üôåüèºüëèüèº', 'Thanks for helping me....

The only fallacy I see with Ben is that sometimes, he follows, instead of leads. 1) He believed all the polls until after the election, where the truth came out. 2) He‚Äôs still willfully blind regarding how the election laws were violated; how the Democrats stuffed the ballot box; and 3) every other form of rampant theft.\n\nBen has guts, but I‚Äôd love to see him exhibit ALL of the guts that I know he has.', 'Come for the twisted, pseudo-intellectual misinformation.

When it‚Äôs silly and they don‚Äôt try to force deep conversation it works.

When you have guests who are your contemporaries or who are your idols, you seem to be able to rally to the surprise and have decent, funny podcasts.  But would it be fair to maybe say you are a bit too cynical to have easy, lovely, fresh conversations with younger, new stars?  You either sound like you are giving newbies paternalistic advice or treating them like babies. When things are going sideways, you ask questions that sound like you are trying to scare them out of the business.

I won‚Äôt be listening anymore.', 'I like the hosts but they are clearly not putting a lot of effort here. The premise of ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know who is coming in‚Äù is a cop out on not having to prepare questions to present the guests. The Awkwafina episode was bad; I felt bad for her. Sean kept getting facts about her wrong, the questions were all over the place, going from her video about vaginas to talking about the passing of her mother and whether to have kids in the future. They comment too much about each other and forget their guest is there. Then there are the tone-deaf questions about her background and general empty questions because they do not prepare for the guests. \n\nGo see Will and Grace, Ozark, and Arrested Development‚Äîthey present great work there.

Sean, fellow ISU grad here (masters in music) but you waited until the year AFTER I graduated to speak at Commencement Ugh üòÇyou were probably too busy on Will &Grace or something amazing üòù Ozark was my last binge, I was confused by arrested development not going to lie, yet I still watched and awkwardly laughed (similar to Curb your Enthusiasm awkward). So As I spend most my time in my car delivering food now..your podcast is such a treat to listen to especially on the hard days. Although I‚Äôm not involved in ‚Äúthe biz‚Äù I do pay attention to the comedy world and am nerding out with the guests you‚Äôve had on! Plus Dudamel!! ‚ÄîWhat?! I was impressed by Bateman‚Äôs knowledge of classical music wow (I knew about Sean he is a legend at ISU) that interview warmed my heart as a former music teacher/band director. üôèüèΩ anyways keep up the good work, please keep it up! Love listening it feels like hanging out with stranger friends...even if the podcast is about nothing ü§£ much luv, Melissa', 'These guys are the funniest!

Love these guys! Great chemistry! Lots of laughs! Keep them coming please!! ‚ù§Ô∏è', 'The friendships between these guys shines through and that is the magic here. Jason, Sean and Will could all stand on their own and be successful. The guests are a well rounded mix. Such good stuff guys. Thanks for the giggles.... Oh, get Walton Goggins on. He is a great interview!', 'There is a Tik Tok of Jason and it is so sexy!!! The show is great!', 'This is my favorite podcast!! Sean, Jason and Will start my week off right. They are hilarious. A must listen!', 'Actually I only have one...love the banter. Thoughtful questions, interviews w people I‚Äôve never heard of...and then I hear something new. Refreshing. I‚Äôll take sarcasm anyway.

Makes my Monday‚Äôs happy!üíïüíïüíï', 'These three have created a great, entertaining, yet informative concept. The hosts have great interactions and clearly enjoy each other and what they are doing. Jason Bateman has a wry, dry humor and asks the best questions. Sean Hayes is quick witted and is the biggest fan girl. Will Arnett is funny, but he has a voice meant for closed captioning.', 'Of the many great qualities about this show, and there are many, it is the playful way these three lads poke fun. You can tell they love and respect each other a lot, so the sarcasm isn‚Äôt harsh or toxic like so much of what passes as humor today. They are the very definition of jovial and good natured hosts.', 'I look forward to this podcast every week. Jason, Will, and Sean are so funny with each other!! I love their dynamic and how they don‚Äôt take themselves so seriously. For me, it‚Äôs refreshing and such a joy to listen to. Thank you!', 'Confession: Apparently I‚Äôm an idiot. I‚Äôve been loving these podcasts so much!  I‚Äôm working my way through and have listened to about 10 so far.  I think Jason, Will and Sean are hysterical and so quick witted.  After quite a few episodes I wondered why everyone talked so fast.  I get that the hosts are super full of energy but even the guests seemed to talk fast. One day, instead of listening on my iphone/car radio, I played one on the Google home.  Low and behold they spoke at the same rate as normal humans!  Apparently my podcast app was set at 1 1/2 speed.  Who knew that was even a thing?  Now, I can‚Äôt listen to it any other way.  I love these so much. If I ever get fired from my job, I‚Äôm going to have to sue you, because many times, I‚Äôve driven past work and took a joy ride because I wanted to listen to one more.  Keep ‚Äòem coming boys.  Thanks for keeping me laughing during this awful pandemic.', 'I have one complaint I hope Sean, Jason or Will with hopefully read! This show is one of the best podcast there is and some of the questions are so great as we learn who the guest are that I hope I hope that we can make every episode longer! Most podcasters prefer closer to 2 hours instead of 1 and the ads are necessary but could not be so a large portion of a short podcast!', 'These 3 guys are obviously great at TV movies etc but this is such a natural fit for them.  Hope that even if they don‚Äôt do this forever weekly they do a few of these a year for years.', 'Are. You. Kidding. Me?! These guys... clearly their combined comedic strength surpasses any of their individual efforts (that was meant to be a compliment). Fantastic chemistry and they ask some fun questions. Great variety of guests. Really feels like you‚Äôre hanging out with them. Thanks for the laughs when we need it most!', 'Love these guys ‚Äî‚Äî only problem is the guests start to tell a story but are then interrupted by the hosts :(.   Let the guest speak!!!!', 'I find that because enjoy the friendship and banter of the hosts, I am tuning into interviews that I would normally skip over and I‚Äôve not been disappointed!  The three hosts are all favorites of mine, so together they are a triple threat!!', 'I gave them 4/5, would be 5 if they left the politics & religion stuff out and a couple of real snoozer guests.']"

Dax is real, I appreciate that he doesn‚Äôt hide who he is or apologize for who he is, he just lays it all out there. It‚Äôs a bonus that we get to know Kristen a little more too!

I wish he had a co-host who also showed some depth and at least got basic culture references. I just listened to the Carey Mulligan interview and the parts where Monica participated were excruciating. Not only did neither of them bother to watch A Promising Young Woman but Monica seemed surprised to even hear what the movie was about. She also didn‚Äôt realize it was directed by one of the main actresses on the Crown or know that Carey is married to a Mumford. Since she doesn‚Äôt seem to have much of a frame of reference generally, she could at least spend two seconds on Wikipedia before each show, jeeze.', 'You only need one person interviewing the guest.

I have always been a fan of Dax and enjoy his personality here as well. The episodes are interesting and deep diving ;I always feel like I am learning something. Dax employs an easygoing banter with the guests so that the interviews are also a lot of fun to listen to. It doesn‚Äôt hurt that Armchair gets top notch guests and experts. As a former addict I give him a ton of credit for his honest approach to this process. I have listened since the beginning and will continue to do so. \n*Also kudos to them for staying away from politics...especially in the crazy climate we currently live in*', 'Long time armchairie here.

Monica, Jesus where to start? Is she 18? She acts like she is Dax‚Äôs younger sister or something the fact check section of the pod is the most painful part of it all, having her (google) correct all the things Dax or any other guest says. Seems like she has very little experience talking on ‚Äúair‚Äù just seems to struggle in conversation period. Worst podcast ever.', 'Your interview with Selma Hayek was mind bending.  Great!  Then!  Then you introduced me to Leon Bridges and I was overwhelmed!! Then!  Then James Banks drop in and I couldn‚Äôt handle it.  Amazed. I just changed my reality.  Thank you.', ""I absolutely love the show! I have listened to probably every OG episode. As a long time listener I see the trend of ‚Äúspin off series‚Äô‚Äù. Armchair and dangerous is awesome! I absolutely love love love Monica, but didn't love the Monica and Jess love boys series. (I am so sorry!) the newest nurture vs nurture- the verdict is still out...I had to turn it off with the incessant beeping in the background-  but I will try again! Overall, I absolutely love Dax and Monica and their chemistry together...If the output is going to be something other than that, maybe it can live under another podcast title."", 'I like the different guests he has on, especially for the expert episodes. Some of the topics are really interesting and this podcast has helped me pass lots of time while feeding my new baby in the middle of the night. My complaints are Dax constantly talking about being an addict no matter what the topic of conversation is, his hijacking of the guests story so he can tell his own similar story, and the constant talking about the ‚Äúpee baby‚Äù with Monica. I do get annoyed with all the elitist Hollywood talk too.', 'Dax and Monica are a perfect team! I love this podcast so much.', 'I really enjoy this podcast, the variety of guests, and the topics of conversation. I actually love everything under the Armchair umbrella. It‚Äôs so well done, funny, intelligent, and I feel like I‚Äôm hanging out with my friends. \n\nI‚Äôve been listening since the beginning and Dax has improved on interrupting and allowing the guests to get a word in edgewise but I‚Äôd still like to hear more opportunity for them to speak. I‚Äôm getting a little tired of the covid ‚Äúpod‚Äù talks. Talking about all your gatherings, trips, and constant testing with large groups of friends is out of touch and obnoxious. Last gripe, as someone with misophonia, I‚Äôm very annoyed by what sounds like Dax talking through a burp or indigestion multiple times in EVERY episode. üòÖ Can we edit that out or something?', 'She can‚Äôt admit how lucky she is like Dax can.  She Complains about anxiety and stress and working so hard. She was a nanny that got lucky. What were her struggles she went through to get to this position? She plays spades all day and argues w Dax for 10 min at the end of the episode. And somehow has ended up with a dream home, a dream car, endless trips and vacations and naps all day. All of her appearances on television or movies are directly because of Dax or Kristen let‚Äôs be real. Love Dax though he‚Äôs a real person who earned his way up there and remembers where he came from.', 'Have listened since day one and love it, especially to make long drives go by quickly. BUT I frequently now skip the fact check as it usually has very little facts and mainly arguing between Dax and Monica. Sometimes I try and weed through to hear facts I‚Äôm interested in, yet I often simply give up.', 'The fact check portion of this episode was brutal. \n\nDax had great points earned a degree in medicine, should be called a Doctor even though they‚Äôre not practicing.  Monica adamantly states they should not.  \n\nMD is an earned title.  The job is physician.  But they will always be ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù.  It was an earned degree.  A cheerleader is not an earned degree.    I‚Äôd love to see her argue with a retired Navy Seal, saying they have no right to refer to themselves as that.  ‚ÄúYou mean you WERE one.‚Äù   \n\nListening to Monica, it‚Äôs obvious she is young, or young-minded, hasn‚Äôt had a lot of life experience.  To say she ‚Äúhates‚Äù when the child of your best friends plays pretend is not a mature person.  To hear her argue with Dax seems like a big brother and baby sister dynamic.  I get that.  But, as in real life, it‚Äôs exasperating to listen to and embarrassing for the one who is not being flexible.  Just uncomfortable. \n\nI would guess the majority of mature, healthy people looking at they‚Äôre threesome dynamic would say it‚Äôs not healthy.  To tell Monica you‚Äôve started up on substance abuse again before your wife?  In the Angela Duckworth interview, I think she was attempting to help when she asked Monica what her long term goal was.  I believe she asked that because she sees what everyone else sees.  Monica seemed to struggle find an answer, and Dax popped in with something like ‚ÄúShe just bought her own house!‚Äù  Which is next door to them, and his wife went to the auction with her.  \n\nWish him well in his sobriety and honesty.  Wish her well in finding her own personal space to grow.  But show is just not for me anymore.  I‚Äôll stop by to see  if anything‚Äôs changed now and then, but it‚Äôs no longer a must-listen to.']"

I started listening to this podcast right after my mother passed away and my mental health was in tatters. Karen and Georgia talk about their experiences with therapy and medication so openly that it removed all the stigmas and fears I had about those things, and showed me how to have honest conversations with my friends and my doctors regarding what I needed to feel better. I‚Äôm grateful for their true crime stories, but I‚Äôm also grateful for their personal tales and the comfort they offer others who are going through hardships. Never before in my life had I heard women casually share how often they were seeing their therapist and what they were working on while there. This podcast changed my life, and I would never want them to stop including those conversations. MFM is just as much about mental health awareness as it is about staying sexy and not getting murdered!', 'I‚Äôm a long time loyal listener and paying member of the fan cult.

They blatantly say they don‚Äôt do the research anymore, they‚Äôre always posting live episodes, and they‚Äôre constantly shoving their thoughts down our throats. I‚Äôm fine listening to opinions, but that‚Äôs all it is anymore. Once I started shopping around and found the comedy in ‚ÄúSmall Town Murder‚Äù and how well researched their episodes are .... I just can‚Äôt justify the flippedness of the ladies anymore.

I‚Äôve subscribed. Found thru Noble Blood podcast. The Diana episode considered‚ÄôThe Crown‚Äô like a documentary, and that made it pretty inaccurate, but it was still interesting. THE WOMAN, Sarah is good too lol', 'I LOVE this podcast. I love the research that you put into each episode. I love your thoughtful commentary. Thank you for the laughs every week!', 'I came from Noble Blood. Both hosts were clever and funny on the crossover episode, so I was excited for this podcast. Then I tried some crime-based episodes. I was surprised by how some seriously egregious conduct gets downplayed if it is perpetrated by a figure they find interesting or have a bias for, then the victim‚Äôs story gets much less time comparatively, and their trauma/suffering gets minimised. \n\nCertainly it‚Äôs important to try to understand the backgrounds and motivations of people who commit crimes, and especially to recognise the ways they have been systematically failed by support structures of all kinds. Humans are far too complex to be all ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad.‚Äù The hosts frequently inform us they are cognizant of this fact, while simultaneously glossing over reprehensible behavior. You can find a person fascinating and still acknowledge how horrendous their actions have been. \n\nPerhaps I just picked the wrong episode (multiple times), but the narrative of several did not address gaping holes of missing information that is readily available and instead seemed crafted solely around the hosts‚Äô opinions. I don‚Äôt know if they themselves had the full picture or were missing crucial details, but that unfortunately led to some over-simplified pronouncements, skewed leaps of logic, and questionable conclusions. (To be fair, I did not try the series of deep dive episodes. So maybe those ones are different).\n\nIf a podcast is just meant to be two people shooting the breeze and airing their opinions, so be it. But with a podcast called ‚ÄúYou Were Wrong About...‚Äù by journalists and authors, who are purportedly flipping the script on the traditional historical record, the scene ought to be properly set with more thorough research. \n\nIt got to feeling like the stories were just a constant bid for listener sympathy for one of the hosts‚Äô favoured individuals, instead of a more balanced representation of the varied sides to the situation. I ended up feeling pandered to. I will move on and continue my search for new podcasts.\n\nThe hosts are undeniably interesting, quick-witted, and entertaining, but I cringe when I think of listeners assuming familiarity with these cases based only on the information provided here.', 'Give more OJ plz', 'Mike and Sarah put the biggest smile on my face whenever I listen to an episode. LOVE THEM!!', ""DO YOU KNOW THAT AUTISM WAS REMOVED FROM THE VACCINE INJURY LIST AFTER THE COMPLAINTS CAME IN? DO YOU KNOW PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES CONVINCED CONGRESS (our tax dollars) to EXCLUDE THEM FROM ANY LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF THEIR VACCINES? Would you buy a carseat for your babies from someone who shifted liability over to the taxpayers??? 1984: The Act, and three other documentaries are available and were created WAY before covid. Educate yourself. \n\nIt's really not funny to laugh about parents who are TERRIFIED to inject the number of vaccinations now being required. As a 55 year old woman, the year they combined vaccinations in 84, as I entered college and was mandated to take the shots, I was given 11 days to live. Thought it was meningitis, later discovered it was encephalitis.  ONE of the injuries possibles. As a psychotherapist, what do I advise a young mom who is showing up in my office shaking, having nightmares, etc because she loves her two babies abs it's nearly time.  There's a lot more to my experience and research and other reasons people don't trust pharmaceutical companies... outside of what should be clearly obvious.  E EVEN THE PAMPHLETS GIVEN AT EACH VACCINE IRREGARDLESS OF WHAT TYPE, and created by the cdc, ADMITS THAT DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURIES MAY OCCUR."", 'I gave this show a try via an episode of Noble Blood by Dana Schwartz, where these two came on as guests. I figured I‚Äôd give their show a try and picked episodes that interest me. \n\nI was immediately stunned by Michael‚Äôs cognitive dissonance towards stereotypes of black and brown people when discussing the OJ Trails. Whether or not I believe he is guilty, when giving facts of an event that not only ruined the victims‚Äô families lives, but reinstated archetypal tropes about black people, black men. If you‚Äôre going to create a podcast called ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Wrong About‚Äù how about excluding stories further prejudices? All that episode did was revive cliches like ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù and I was honestly disappointed. \n\nWhen I tried other episodes, I couldn‚Äôt ignore Michael‚Äôs white liberalism and narcissism, as he‚Äôs the first to discover research all the while calling sex trafficking victims sex workers. Like what??? I couldn‚Äôt even finish that episode I immediately stop there. \n\nThe lack of acknowledgment in privilege by being able to have a platform to talk about history only to pick and choose what ‚Äúfacts‚Äù you‚Äôre presenting to tell your opinion. This is not something I‚Äôm ‚Äúwrong‚Äù about rather your opinion on it. \n\nWhich is fine, that‚Äôs storytelling, especially for historians. But I didn‚Äôt need to hear Michael say he was a journalist to know this show was ran by one. As a writer and historian, it‚Äôs great to tell stories in history and obviously, someone is going to state their opinion. But that‚Äôs not how this show is presented and I wish Sarah and Michael would stop telling BIPOC stories in history if they‚Äôre not recognizing their own biases. \n\nSarah, I believe you‚Äôd do great alone. But working with a huffington post journalist, who has to mansplain and interrupt you to get his smug arguments across, is definitely bringing this show down. \n\nFor History lovers, I recommend Noble Blood and Lore for any podcast listeners, as these two hosts, DIRECTLY call out racism, supremacy, and even their accounts when telling the stories of BIPOC people in history.', 'There‚Äôs nothing I don‚Äôt love about this podcast.

If the hosts just stuck to the storyline instead of interjecting with inane prattle, it would be a far better product.

What do you expect for Buzzfeed and Huffington Post,...', 'This is a pretty good summation of the whole fiasco. With that said it would have been helpful if you read Jane Mayer‚Äôs book. She goes into significant detail about Thomas‚Äô crude nature overall; his utter lack of qualifications; and the black community‚Äôs willingness to turn a blind eye. Also Connell West wrote an excellent essay on the subject', 'I love love love this show, especially the OJ saga. I appreciate your points of view and all the time you obviously spend researching.

Highly highly recommend!', 'This podcast is truly one of the best out there. Full stop.

Done listening.', 'The very premise of the show is to enlighten people with knowledge on all sorts of random subjects you may or may not have ever pondered about (or even heard of), and the only solid way to absorb new information is with an open mind. Since these are two humans sharing the research and not two robots, they are going to share their personal thoughts and experiences with the information, just as we are doing ourselves silently when we listen. It shouldn‚Äôt cloud your ability to absorb the information and take away what you want from it just because you may hear a hot take from a host that you personally don‚Äôt agree with. \n\nAt the end of the day, I am so grateful for the robust library of topics covered thoroughly by Josh and Chuck, I personally enjoy their camaraderie and ability to hand off pieces of info to present along with their own reactions. At times I suppose I feel that Chuck seems condescending to Josh for no apparent reason and that he appears a bit bitter which is at times a bit disheartening because of how non-bitter Josh seems, but again, my slight and sporadic prickling to one of the hosts‚Äô personalities at times is in no way enough to cloud the litany of info I am getting and the overall enjoyment I get. \n\nThank you for all you do, guys!', 'Been listening for years and really enjoy the facts and banter. Both Chuck and Josh are quick witted, smart, and easy going. They are an essential part of my continuing education.

I guess I will keep looking.', 'Love these guys', 'Josh and Chuck have become more political- as we all have in the wake of startling and disturbing behavior from the ‚Äúformer guy‚Äù. They‚Äôve made it clear that they don‚Äôt support racism, misogyny, or other inhuman ideas. I applaud them for being willing to admit their faults and attempting to educate the world at large about issues the US has so carefully whitewashed. Keep spreading love, kindness, and good info Josh and Chuck!', 'I used to love this show but the virtue signaling and politics have totally turned me off .', 'Are you up looking at random reviews at 23:00 again?', 'First of all, their political views have been obvious for years, it‚Äôs just only until recently have they been talking more often about subjects that are politicized. They still give you the facts unbiased they just offer their perspective on their personal views on it. It‚Äôs a bad idea and a bit distasteful to have these debated subjects, but most of the people that are writing these reviews saying that this is just liberal propaganda are getting mad way to easily about a slight annoyance. Chill out, and if you know a subject is one you know you‚Äôll disagree on just skip it. Not hard and it‚Äôs still a good podcast even with the political topics. \n\n(Also if anyone producing the show or whatever reads this just for the sake of show rating chill out a bit on stuff you‚Äôll get hate for weather or not it‚Äôs necessary hate)', 'This is and has been a top 5 podcast of mine for years. Josh and Chuck are true pros of the podcast game, and their rapport with each other is every bit as good as the wide variety of topics they cover in the show. Recent negative reviews from people who can‚Äôt bear to hear a differing opinion should be ignored, by and large this is as far from a political podcast as it gets.', 'I love this show because I love Josh, he is so kind in his thinking and truly open-minded. Chuck seems to condescend to him sometimes and speak down to him and is not as free-thinking or open-minded as he likes to pretend he is.

That‚Äôs actually a real quote. \n\nI wonder how he slept at night knowing that he was making criminals (including murderers) feel better about themselves and feel better and refreshed about going out to do more. I wonder how he (or his clueless wife) felt about his man crush and being BFF with a serial killer, knowing that he was out killing? (This actually ends up being funny, but I won‚Äôt spoil it)\n\nThe best part is that they seriously think this is ‚Äúart‚Äù. Just because you call something art, doesn‚Äôt make it so. It was a man that was obsessed with being an arm chair social worker and giving penance to violent criminals. It‚Äôs not art, it‚Äôs complicity.  No matter how much pretty music you add to the background, he was a jerk who enabled and helped many crimes occur. I have to admit, I was hoping one of his murderer friends was going to be the reason for his death. It would have been so poetic and ‚Äúartistic‚Äù. Sorry, not sorry.', 'This was one of my all time favorite podcasts.

The story is fascinating and well produced.', 'This podcast could‚Äôve been much better because I think the Apology Line is an interesting topic, but it just kind of rambled on and in the end was disappointing. It also makes me sad to hear Marissa care so much about Allen when he really treated her poorly it seems.', 'Although masterfully produced, as most Wondery podcasts are, I felt misled because I thought it was a story about true crime', 'Very interesting story about pre-internet remote communities', 'Thanks Marissa and your husband for creating this podcast.', 'An interesting idea, though I find the protagonist, Alan, to be a megalomaniac, self-involved misogynist. Telling a victim of domestic violence that she‚Äôs responsible for being beat up over and over? Yet befriending a serial killer and treating him like a hero? What a pig this guy Alan is.He is unimaginative in his approach to masculinity‚Äîa true conformisy‚Äîand his relationship with the narrator. Later on in the season, you learn that he has been dependent on his wife all along financially. All while he has been valorizing his own work and minimizing her work‚Äîthe work that funded his little hobby, and his anti-capitalist pretension. What a loser. The woman narrating the podcast seems so subservient to his unfailing ego in a way that‚Äôs a bit disturbing to listen to. The recordings are mostly hard to listen to, because they‚Äôre so garbled and unclear. I can make out about 30% of their content, which just makes the whole point of the show a bit moot.', 'Appreciated the look back to NYC art culture in the 80‚Äôs.', 'The only mystery here is why an apparently intelligent, talented woman would stick by a man who treated her like so much furniture. And why would she still want to talk about him all these years later? She was the only contributing breadwinner in the household. Yet she was supposed to supportive with his ‚Äúart‚Äù career but he didn‚Äôt want to be bothered to help her with her actual art career? Still, it‚Äôs worth a listen because there are interesting characters to uncover here.

I get it it‚Äôs real life. 3 stars for the good stuff.', 'Starts off great but goes downhill fast after the second episode. Not really about the apology line, the host(the artists wife) tries hard to make about herself and their relationship versus sticking to the story. I finished the series, but it wasn‚Äôt worth the time I spent listening.', 'The way the podcast brings you in makes you feel like it will be a true crime story. However, as you continue to listen it‚Äôs a story more about the relationship between the narrator and her husband (Mr. Apologie), and her observations and realizations about his life before and after his death. She describes the line, but focuses more on the toll it took on Mr. Apologie. Then to find out in the last episode that the supposed serial killer was all just a man lying on the phone was very anticlimactic. It just was not what I felt it claimed to be, and not really my cup of tea.', 'Loved the podcast! I binged it in one session. Very interesting story, and it was produced well. Highly recommend giving it a listen!', 'Really truly a riveting podcast. I‚Äôm obsessed. Not quite sure what that says about me....', 'I‚Äôm interested in the story but it can barely understand the recordings. It‚Äôs not a volume issue but poor quality audio', 'Awesome podcast!!', 'I had no idea the Apology Line existed. The social impact of it fascinated me as well as the glimpses into how it seemed to impact Allan mentally and emotionally. Paintings and music and other forms of art capture the emotions and mentality of the artist in a single piece and then it‚Äôs frozen in time. I learned how living art is so different. Marissa, thank you for sharing this story. Your tone was perfect to deliver your story and Mr. Apology‚Äôs story.', 'Hey do a show on Dr. Pepper plz', 'This is so well done by marissa, I hope it doesn‚Äôt end soon. It‚Äôs really special. Like Alan invented the first podcast. People just want to hear stories to feel less alone so thank you for sharing a story that is so epic everyone should know. I only wish I was in NYC at that time and it  could have been a part of my own memories.', 'I‚Äôm not sure what the point of this podcast was- it‚Äôs definitely not true crime; it‚Äôs kind of about the narrators relationship with her ex aka mr apology but their relationship isn‚Äôt all that interesting and there‚Äôs no nuance or introspection. They could have just played us the apology phone calls with minimal framing and it would have been more affecting and gripping.', 'Love it so far! Let‚Äôs see where it goes ...\n\nEdit:  5 stars to 3. It just was not as exciting as it wore on.  Glad this is just 7 eps.', 'Listening to the Apology line made me wonder what would I call for if this line was available. I was sympathetic to some callers specifically Sam‚Äôs call. I also feel terrible for Ms. Apology bc she put on hold a lot of things she wanted in life to support her husband‚Äôs art. This is a very unique experience of someone‚Äôs life who touched and help others through the Apology line. Over all I really liked this podcast I think the Apology line is a wonderful concept and it‚Äôs kinda sad that other people started to copy cat and profited on someone else‚Äôs idea.', 'This podcast could only be 2 or max 3 episodes. I was expecting something more interesting. The story is just okay.', 'This is such a unique podcast I couldn‚Äôt stop listening!', 'If he could have found a way to monetize the line it might be one of the busiest pods online today.

I also understand ads as I‚Äôm an avid podcast listener. With that said, the interrupting in the middle of a story is rude. Play them before n after and possibly 1 in the middle of the show.

Could‚Äôve been done in a single hour-long episode, honestly.', 'This is a goldmine of a story that Wondery butchered', 'I could not stop listening. Absolutely fascinating.

However these podcasts about racism are part of the problem not the solution. \n\nSaying that white people are racist purely because they‚Äôre white is ignorant and racist. Any ethnic, racial or cultural stereotypes based on these factors alone is a racist comment. It doesn‚Äôt help unite it further divides. We should celebrate our differences and work to find common ground not attack people based on the color of their skin. That means attacking white people just because they‚Äôre white. \n\nIf these racist episodes continue this podcast needs to be canceled.

On the one hand, a lot of what they talk about in terms of psychology is already intuitive, but even then, it‚Äôs fun to understand the reasons behind why people are the way they are.', 'When one party is willing to protect irrationality to hide themselves from their own evil white supremacy, and when that party uses emotion exclusively to the point where its followers are a cult that is willing to kill an officer with an extinguisher in our Nations capital... that is NOT a brand.  That is fascism.  \n\nUsing the ‚Äúdecision‚Äù of Fascism or Democracy, and Americas political cage of two party dominance around Trumps wall as some shallow example of brand silliness, ...is a repugnant and sickening debasement of humanity.

Please don‚Äôt listen if you can‚Äôt even be open to the message. Your message of hate is not welcome here! Thank you Dave Ramsey and all the Ramsey Personalities! Your message and teachings have changed my life for the better! God Bless You!', 'I love what Dave and his team do for people regardless of the show format! I prefer the old show with just Dave, but I also see the benefit and wisdom of passing the torch.', 'Dave , the people that are leaving you reviews that are not 5 star reviews are just full of crap. Love you Dave keep up the great work and help you always provide.', 'I sure miss the old days when Dave helped people. His cohosts are unqualified. Dave needs to bring on a rock star.  I recommend he needs to read Entreleadership.', 'More often than not you guys are editing out where Dave says his name in the title from past episodes and replaying those old segments as if they are new.', 'Amazing advice, love to listen! I‚Äôm loving the co-hosts my favorites are Dr. John, Christy Wright, and Rachel Cruze üòä\nThank you for helping to change so many family trees! \nKeep up the good work and God bless! üëçüèª', 'I‚Äôm writing this review after being a regular listener of the show for 5 years. The first two years after discovering Dave Ramsey, I hardly missed an episode. Dave‚Äôs advice seems tough and straightforward, and was helpful in conceptualizing my future finances as a recent college grad. Since those years, I have learned more about economics from other sources and my steadfast following of Dave has waned. To start, Dave‚Äôs advice is only useful for middle/upper middle class people and families. For people struggling to break generation of poverty, his advice is tone-deaf and out of touch. The fundamental beliefs that Dave repeats each episode simply aren‚Äôt applicable or reasonable for most Americans in 2021. \n\nNow my gentle skepticism shifted dramatically at the onset of Covid-19. Dave‚Äôs out of touch advice couldn‚Äôt have been more poorly timed as he said the millions of out of work Americans should stop seeking a government bailout and just ‚Äúbootstrap‚Äù their way out of a once in a hundred years economic catastrophe. Furthermore, for anybody curious, there have been several lawsuits against Dave‚Äôs company alleging discriminatory practices. I could overlook Dave‚Äôs staunch religiosity in my early years of following, but it‚Äôs now led him to force employees to work WITHOUT masks in a closed office (employees have alleged they‚Äôre discouraged from wearing a mask in the age of Covid) and firing staff after learning that they‚Äôre part of the LGBTQ community. For me, that‚Äôs a dealbreaker. No financial advice is worth gross neglect of caring for others.', 'I like listening to this podcast as the hosts offer free advice. It is educational to leafrom other people‚Äôs experiences. As for the negative reviews ‚Äî they have more to do with Dave‚Äôs personal beliefs and opinions. If you live long enough, you will realize that some people do not share your opinions. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs become okay to cancel people on the basis of political disagreements. It‚Äôs very anti-American. Dave, if you are reading this, I appreciate your honesty and your ability to get to the point.', 'Unfortunately since the show platform has changed to having a co-host the show has become difficult to listen to. The co-host often distracts from the callers questions and interjects nonsense into the conversation.', 'This show is worth listening to!', 'Dave‚Äôs simple approach can help lots of people, and has helped me. His show used to be motivating and entertaining. However, he now seems to have a harder and harder time containing his ego. His refusal to acknowledge that people can succeed with a plan other than his makes him seem very small.\n\nPlus, the rebrand with co-hosts is awful. They are mostly parrots who are fearful they will regurgitate the baby steps incorrectly. They rarely add anything of substance. It would be refreshing if he let someone disagree with him in order spark a healthy discussion/debate on various topics.', 'Used to really enjoy the podcast.  It‚Äôs now unlistenable.  The co-hosts are just brutal.  Lap dogs that can‚Äôt regurgitate Dave‚Äôs thought fast enough and don‚Äôt have an original thought in their heads.  Too bad- used to be a must listen for me.', 'Dave is starting to sound like what he refers to as the clueless relative living in the basement. \n\nThe Ramsey talent diffuses and deflects the angry Dave. That was a sound production move to have them as co-hosts.', 'Love this podcast!! \nMy husband and I (ages 27 and 32) are now 100% debt free and we just paid our home off! Thanks to Dave Ramsey we are changing our family legacy!', 'Listening from Portland, Oregon. Ramsey and his team set us up for success if we can deal with the discipline.', 'Chris interrupts or just echos Dave.  Or says the wrong thing!!! Can‚Äôt listen to Chris.', 'While I agree with your synopsis on Dave Ramsey‚Äôs cohosts (and would add here that most of Dave‚Äôs pre-COVID audience seems to prefer his old solo format to his post-COVID format with constant cohosts), I would correct your very erroneous statement that ‚ÄúFYI you don‚Äôt call phds ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù (ostensibly referring to Dr. John Delony) since ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not an MD.‚Äù You are wrong about this, and anyone who does have a doctoral degree (myself included) would correct you. This is why it‚Äôs called a ‚Äòdoctorate degree.‚Äô I say this to help you avoid: 1) Being wrong, and 2) Intentionally and ignorantly disrespecting people who have spent years and years to obtain the highest level of education possible in any given area of graduate study by not using their proper title!', 'I‚Äôve been listening to your financial advice for years and no idea you were a raging racist. Your tribute to Rush and lovingly fawning over such a hateful person is the nail in the coffin for me #restinpissdave', 'I really bought in to his method at first, though I was really already in good financial shape.  I recommended him to a family member that was on hard times and a few others.  I‚Äôm really regretting that now.  I can‚Äôt believe some of the stuff he says now....   also his advice has helped many but not all of it is sound advice.  It‚Äôs like my loving Christian uncle has gone to the dark side.  Praying for him and his family.', 'I never write reviews but after seeing all the negative reviews I had to. My husband and I married young and were struggling finically when we started listening to Dave Ramsey and following his baby steps. We are now 30 living on one income in the Seattle area so I can stay home with our son, we are out of debt, have a fully funded emergency fund, investing regularly and have a 5 year plan to pay off our home. I thank Dave for this. All the people hating on Dave Ramsey and saying he is out of touch etc etc have not tried his plan for them selves. This plan requires sacrifice! People don‚Äôt want to sacrifice they want the government to bail them out! And they can‚Äôt handle anyone with a different opinion!\n\nDave‚Äôs rants are my favorite! He gives great financial and life advice! I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the new format with the other personalities. They have their own podcasts so we could go listen to them there if we wanted.', 'I‚Äôve yet to listen to DAVE Ramsey but I‚Äôll definitely subscribe now that I see the cancel culture has gone after him!! üôå', 'Scrooge McDuck. So out of touch. Missing the joy experience. Another old guy practicing performative masculinity. blech.', 'Dave has a heart for people and when people follow his advice they will live more fruitful, happy and healthy lives. Really people... get thicker skin and listen to his words and intention. It‚Äôs all to help people get out of debt and live with a lot less stress. It‚Äôs to leave a legacy for their children!! Many debt free people support and thank you Dave!', 'Quick story: I‚Äôve been given more Christmas gifts over the years than I should have ever been blessed with, but I will never take it for granted. Many of those gifts, I can‚Äôt tell you what they were or what year I received them. But I do remember one year in my early 20s, my older sister gifted me Total Money Makeover. It sat on my bookshelf and collected dust for a couple of years. Little did I realize that Christmas Day I received the greatest gift I‚Äôve ever received. And that‚Äôs no disrespect to all the others I received, but this one has gone on to teach me how to be financially responsible, how to not fall into the FICA scheme, how to invest, and how to change not only my family‚Äôs future, but to be a beacon of light for all those around me who value my advice.\n\nI took a chance and surrendered myself to Dave‚Äôs written plan in 2016. In 2017, I paid off my student loans and my auto loan. I had two sets of student loans taken out in 2009 and 2014 that totaled nearly $30,000. An auto loan in 2011 was another nearly $25,000 mistake. All told, I now have 10 closed accounts. Five were student loans, one an auto loan, and the other four were store credit cards. There was a lot of stupid in there. I owned my mistakes and I paid them off. I didn‚Äôt want one penny from the government and I still don‚Äôt. All I want is for them to stay out of my life! Now I‚Äôm living debt free and have been for going on four years!\n\nI‚Äôm saving up to pay for a home with cash because I refuse to ever pay another dime of interest to a bank and allow them to profit off of my blood, sweat, and tears. Everything they stand for is nearly every reason why almost 80 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. But you have the power to take control of your life. In order to do that, you need to take control of your money. Control your emotions and you can control your money. Learn how to budget and follow the seven baby steps. I wouldn‚Äôt endorse these things if they didn‚Äôt work. They work! I‚Äôm living proof, and you can be too!\n\nDream It! Believe It! Work For It! Live It!', 'He‚Äôs been on a path for the last year or so and it‚Äôs only gotten worse. He‚Äôs so greatly disconnected to the average person and their finances these days he‚Äôs not even speaking from a relatable point of view anymore', 'This podcast has really helped me start a new financial path for my life ,and this year I‚Äôm on a path to pay off all of my student loan debt and start an emergency fund. So far, I fully paid off my car, and it feels great. Thanks Dave and all the other personalities for helping me change my perspective on money!', 'He hates gays and loves Rush Limbaugh.', 'Reading the negative reviews below it is not about his politics or Covid responses.  It is about the rapid deterioration of his show which he is not calling it the Dave Ramsey Show anymore. I can see why he does not want his name attached to this horrible format. Listened to the show for years and years.  Stopped when he for some odd reason brought on guest host.  They are terrible and distracet from Dave. Can not believe he does not hear this. A few radio host that can carry a three hour daily show and dave is one. The co-host speak in cliches and bring nothing to the conversation. Tired of hearing I am going to speak the truth to you and there is darkness out there.  Please Dave before your show drifts into oblivion go back solo.', 'his disdain for poor people is excruciatingly obvious.', 'Dave Ramsey is not culturally relevant and does not represent diversity, inclusion, and equality for all. He does not seem to understand that everyone isn‚Äôt afforded the same opportunity and this intentional denial  makes him a disgrace to the America that he claims to love.', 'I was appalled to hear that ‚Äúlefties‚Äù were spoken about in a very derogatory and one-sided way. This particular lefty happens to be a millionaire and then some at age 57....on her own....and the only government ‚Äúhand out‚Äù I expect is what I paid into for Social Security but I don‚Äôt depend on it because the government is dysfunctional and not just the left side. Please‚Ä¶. !!! Your listeners are not that ignorant. \n\nAlso, on the same show, Rush Limbaugh was praised???? Seriously?  He happens to be one of the most misogynistic and bigoted individual I have ever heard in my whole life. A hatred spewer.  Sad that you have now alienated about half of your listeners. You have done a lot good in your life.... sad you have chosen to divide good, hard working Americans and perpetuate the polarization that exists in this good country.', 'I used to like this podcast but I no longer feel welcome.', 'He‚Äôs a Christian but his political views are creeping up.  He praises people like Rush Limbaugh. As he gets older he‚Äôs getting very set in his way and very hypocritical', 'Dave firing an employee, for someone else‚Äôs opinion that he didn‚Äôt like, is pure evil.  It shows a deep lack of character. \n\nHis continued support of a serial adulterer, while firing a single woman for getting pregnant is not only evil, it‚Äôs repugnant. \n\nJesus tells us: ‚ÄúBeware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep‚Äôs clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits.‚Äù\n\nDave is peddling rotten fruit.', 'Chris Hogan is very annoying to listen to on this show alongside of Dave. He seems like he‚Äôs trying to anticipate what he thinks Dave will say and it‚Äôs almost always stated prematurely. For example, yesterday he stated with absolute confidence ‚Äúyou have a marriage problem!‚Äù to a guy that was trying to explain why he and his wife kept separate credit cards. And although that might be the case, it was definitely not the moment to announce that as a conclusion.\nAgain, it wasn‚Äôt that the message was necessarily incorrect but that it was hurriedly rushed to as a definite conclusion.  \n\nI really appreciate how down-to-earth Christy is, and I like it when she Dave and Christy are together. She doesn‚Äôt simply echo Dave, like the other personalities do. They‚Äôve got a complimentary energy as a duo. She seems like an outsider, in a good way. She‚Äôs empathetic to listeners and asks clarifying questions before giving advice. \nA few of the others seem to try to copy Dave in a way that simply makes them annoying to hear. You feel like saying, ‚Äújust let him talk. He is sitting right there and can say it better and deliver the message appropriately!‚Äù', 'You can easily invest in index funds and not pay fees on the mutual funds he promotes. Also can earn rewards points on credit cards and benefit from them if paid off monthly. ALSO can keep a low interest mortgage. His program may work for people that are seriously in debt but why pay for a program when you‚Äôre in debt to begin with and you can get all the financial advise you need free online. \nFrom what I‚Äôm reading recently on how he manages his company I believe even his management style is stuck in the 80s. Toxic cultures do not make for long term loyalty.\nPS There are a lot of other podcasts that discuss how millionaires made their wealth.', 'Reading these comments are crazyyyyyy üòÇ. A lot of angry people. Keep up the great work Dave üí™üèΩ', 'Dave,\nNot everyone is trying to get wealthy.  Some people are just trying to pay their rent and feed their family.  Instead of doing your rants..:maybe listen.  You are so worried about being right that your mean....and this has nothing to do with the left.', 'awesome podcast', 'Okay I know that this is a rating place and should be used just for that but i am so angry at the people hating on Dave I just have to stand up for what Dave believes and what I believe too. So people out there who think they really know Dave probably don‚Äôt period. Because ya know what THEY ARE NOT GOD or a close relative or a good friend so people out there SHUT UP!!!!! You know I say that the only judgment that really matters  is the one done by the ultimate judge, God. That is al I have to say.', 'He doesn‚Äôt give accurate advise. And the advise he does give comes from a place of judgement, not a place of caring. Time and time again he‚Äôs stated he wouldn‚Äôt date anyone with dept. time and time again he pressures people to marry before they‚Äôre ready. Just not a fan. Love Dave and Chris. John and Ken are okay, but don‚Äôt seem to have a good grasp when financial questions come their way. I don‚Äôt mind the cohost setup, been listening a long time, but I‚Äôd prefer the show be about financial issues. It‚Äôs going in a very different direction.', 'Listen to Dave, he practices what he preaches.  If you are patient and follow this common sense advice you will prosper just like I have.', 'Watch how someone walks with the broken of this world and you will see their true personality.', 'Like the co-hosts...don‚Äôt like Dave always talking over them.', 'Dave‚Äôs advice is to always ‚Äústick to the baby steps‚Äù and follow the proven plan.  I‚Äôm not sure why he‚Äôs not following his own advice in regards to his show.  Co-hosts and  ‚Äúrebranding‚Äù the show won‚Äôt equate to the gains he‚Äôs anticipating.  He‚Äôs alienating the people that helped build his empire.  \n\nJust saying.', 'While I like what Dave Ramsey stands for in general....I haven‚Äôt figured out the rationale to paying off a 3-4% interest mortgage with, say 100k principle, rather than to invest that 100k and make a lot more than 3% In other investment opportunities. If the best you can do with your money is to save 3% which is also tax deductible than you need to find a better financial advisor than Dave Ramsey.', 'Love the Dave Ramsey Show!!üòäüòÜ', 'I love listening to this podcast! Best way to keep your mind in the game and strong towards financial freedom!\nA must listen to anyone wherever they are financially, spiritually and relationally- they cover a lot not only about money but in all aspects of improving your life. \nGive it an episode or so and you‚Äôll thank me later!', 'Awful terrible advice', 'What is the point of a co-host when they only know how to regurgitate the Baby Steps?  And eventually Dave just waits for them to finish so he can have the last word?  Any consultant could correct these problems for you.']"

While the topics discussed are certainly interesting, the show‚Äôs potential is basically ruined by the hosts‚Äô unwillingness to have a deep and critical discussion.', ""PSA requires no disclosure. The podcast‚Äôs commentators are unapologetically Democrats, self-proclaimed ‚Äúpartisan hacks,‚Äù happy to put away the humor, stories, and self-reflection when it comes to the serious issue of electing Democrats to office.\n\tFull disclosure: I am not a Democrat nor was I a fan of Barack Obama‚Äôs leadership as president. At the same time, I am not a Republican nor do I advocate for anyone to become one should they have dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party. I am, however, an intellectual and a political junkie, one to embrace new experiences and seek to understand perspectives different than my own. After a high school classmate and lifelong Democrat posted her podcast of choice on Facebook, I decided to binge-listen to four years of PSA in six months of 2020 to forge forward in the manner of the Hegelian dialectic. I continue to seek understanding of our political world today, and this podcast has, in some ways, aided my journey.\n        Like it or not, the 2016 election forced Democrats to grapple with the problems of Obama era incrementalism, that time-sensitive issues in the status quo cannot wait. PSA embraced this struggle during their early years. Clearly dismayed by an unforeseeable future with the demagogue Donald Trump as president, the commentators treated 2017 as the time for critical reflection on where the Democratic Party stood and what must change. The threat of Trump‚Äôs reelection was ‚Äúan existential crisis,‚Äù reason enough to take this reflection seriously, to vow 2020 would be a different story. Lovett was the only one, though, willing to stick his neck out to call out problems within the party that had not yet been addressed. Favreau, on the other hand, was the most resistant to change, the least willing to critique the Democratic party.\n         For a while, PSA embraced critique, especially in 2017 and 2018's growing calls for gender equality. PSA supported the #MeToo movement through steady reporting of these cases (including of Democrats) and the significance of the media‚Äôs role in their reveal. They invested time digging into the Kavanaugh case. The failure to prevent his confirmation only added fuel to PSA‚Äôs ever-burning fire that, no matter what else happens, Trump must go.\n\t2019's promising primary of nearly 30 candidates left a great deal of space for PSA‚Äôs critique, myself leaning in to cherish every minute. All that possibility meant the commentators felt free to critique then-primary-candidate Joe Biden‚Äîas did the front-runner‚Äôs opponents. When revelations emerged of eight women accusing Biden of inappropriate touching, his opponents seized the moment to stand with the accusers. PSA rightfully criticized Joe Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúapology.‚Äù At the same time, they and mainstream media moved past it quickly. As Democratic primary debates unfolded, PSA seemed to carry out a symbolic progressivism (wokenism)‚Äîaiming for progressive policies while also clearly favoring candidates Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, excusing their less-than-progressive moments even when the polls did not. The commentators would respond that so-called purity tests do not help the party. However, as they once recognized on the show, insufficient self-critique is why the Democratic Party finds itself where it is now.\n\tAfter South Carolina‚Äôs Clyburn-induced Biden victory, Tommy Vietor led the crew in breathing a collective sigh of relief that the previous episode‚Äôs reluctant acceptance of Sanders as nominee was simply a bad dream. Once the mainstream media found an alternative to Big Bad Bernie, all resources fell to Joe Biden. No matter what Biden did‚Äîlying about his biography; revising his historical policy stances in finance, criminal justice, and foreign wars; misrepresentations of corporate support in the healthcare industry; supposed ‚Äúgaffes‚Äù (featuring at least covert racism); disrespect of women (Anita Hill, eight cases of inappropriate touching, and one blanket denial of Tara Reade‚Äôs sexual assault allegations after a kid-gloved interview on MSNBC); lack of remorse or responsibility (only justifications); and a generally poor candidacy (low energy, enthusiasm, and responsiveness)‚Äîmedia swept it under the rug because the alternative is worse. Democrats treat not only Republicans as the worse alternative but also left-wing candidates.\n        For all the criticism they were willing to give in earlier months, PSA settled early on a Biden candidacy. There‚Äôs no arguing with the polls, they said, and the voters crowned Biden the winner. Party unity and electability became more important than principle, than bettering the party with a superior candidate‚Äîor even challenging the nominee to become that superior candidate. Similar to any hint of criticism toward the Obama administration, the PSA commentators deflect negativity by even a single media source (‚Äúthe Bernie media‚Äù) as feeding into Republican talking points and fear taking it seriously would cost the party an election.\n       Overall, even though PSA has admitted some mistake with Obama era incrementalism, nothing since the start of the show has changed. While I enjoyed the first couple of years of actual critique, the party of ‚ÄúYes We Can‚Äù became ‚ÄúNo We Can‚Äôt...until voters show up for us and conditions are just right.‚Äù Now, in 2021, voters showed up, making conditions just right, but many Democrats prefer loyalty to the same old Obamacrat incrementalism, whose neglect of the working class partially led to a Donald Trump presidency, over boldness and progressive change. It‚Äôs much easier to say the Republicans are nuts than to admit the Democrats‚Äîwho do the same thing over again hoping for different results‚Äîare not much better. While this was an informative, horizon-broadening podcast exposing me to the Democratic ‚Äúpartisan hack‚Äù viewpoint, all of its fun moments, it does not itself grapple with Hegelian truth; PSA instead finds its truths self-evident. So, the intellectual exercise stops."", 'This podcast is for Democrats. There is said it. I‚Äôm unaware of how often people look to these reviews but if you‚Äôre out there seeing this just know that yes this podcast is biased. These bros are democrats and they don‚Äôt hide it or pretend to be fair. That being said they do bring bring some nuance and much needed laughter to this chaos. I don‚Äôt know what to say other than that or what is really needed to be said. Some reviews come in stating they are centrist and or want to have someone who is playing the Republican for this group or something. Sir, please don‚Äôt come to the ice cream shop and ask for a steak and then give it a 1 star when your steak needs weren‚Äôt met.', 'Rent everything own nothing 2030, WEF enthusiasts. Yikes!', 'It‚Äôs not good. It‚Äôs bad, really really bad.', 'I look forward to my PSA episode twice a week. I‚Äôve learned so much from them.', 'They all have great radio voices, but they are incredibly biased and misinformed.  It seems like they just read msm headlines and regurgitate them.  They need to read the truth and start looking at both sides', 'I am a registered Democrat in NYC.  I crave media that strives to venture forth from the Left or Right wing echo chambers.  This, unfortunately, is not it.  There is literally no objectivity with any of their takes.  Democrats have never done anything wrong nor been wrong on any policy, when we know we have.  If you want a show that cheerleads every popular democratic trope, this is your show.  If you are looking for thoughtful and critical discussion of politics and issues facing us today, then look elsewhere. Based on the five star reviews, those people want an echo chamber, which is sad.', 'I have learned so much from this podcast. It helped me understand all the minutiae of the process of the election and certification and what could happen and would likely happen. These guys are funny and relatable but when it comes right down to it, it‚Äôs information from people who just happen to know how all this stuff works, who love politics and who have been active in politics for a long time. It‚Äôs kind of like how I always liked teachers who really loved the subject they were teaching. It‚Äôs obviously left leaning. I would actually say they are pretty fair about everything and any actual info given is absolutely accurate but they are Democrats and their opinions are liberal and and they never claim to be anything else. They are passionate about their opinions and it‚Äôs one of the reasons I‚Äôm a huge fan. It‚Äôs about politics but they never lose sight of the fact that politics & policy is really about making life better for the people who are served by it and who are unfortunately sometimes at it‚Äôs mercy. They are less cynical than many political pundits. Also I particularly enjoy their commercials because you can tell they hate reading them. Sometimes they openly mock the copy. But it works for them. Only podcast commercials I don‚Äôt skip. Some of the only ones that have actually caused me to purchase a product in the past (Love my Bombas socks) If you like this you might enjoy Lovett or Leave It with Jon Lovett, who is probably the funniest of the PSA hosts, as well as Pod Save The World with Tommy Vietor if you want the same level of info & coverage on a global scale. I have yet to be disappointed by any Crooked Media content.', 'Let‚Äôs actually look at facts. Ted Cruz going to Mexico??! That‚Äôs a thing? Unless he can single handedly stop the freeze in Texas, why is it a bad thing he takes his family to Mexico? Yes- it is bad optics. But that didn‚Äôt harm anyone.\nI study the facts. Biden calls ‚Äúa snow day‚Äù and that‚Äôs okay. \n\nOur current commander in chief needs medical help. His cognitive abilities have been declining in full view of the American public. He‚Äôs signed how many executive orders in his first month??? He himself stated anyone who uses the power of executive orders to reform (change policy) is a dictator. And people aren‚Äôt holding him accountable for his own actions. There are so many other issues. \n\nOne other thing regarding Texas and the freeze... AOC stated this issue happened because TX needs MORE windmills... huh?! what?! So that they all freeze?! If something fails, why should we -the American people- get taxed to increase the amount of these ‚Äúwindmills‚Äù that have proved to be unreliable? The money comes from tax payers. And where is the relief that Biden promised? Still no stimulus check. Start holding these people accountable... please! I‚Äôm praying that all people just hold themselves accountable and see that we are losing our rights and freedoms as Americans. We are no longer America. We are no longer a democracy-we are under a dictatorship where we as the American people have no voice. \n\nBut go on and continue your podcast and continue spreading misinformation. I‚Äôm so disappointed that we are so divided; and that the ‚Äúunity‚Äù promised is no where to be seen. Recently, person holding a Trump flag gets pummeled on an ice rink... but BLM and ANTIFA can right for 3-6 months last summer and more people died there than on your so-called insurrection Jan. 6th 2020 and it‚Äôs all ok; it‚Äôs all justified in your eyes. \n\nTeaching a theory of white privilege and how bad the whites are; teaching and spreading the phrase ‚Äúwhite guilt‚Äù along with many others.... how is this going to unite a country? It DOESN‚ÄôT. It‚Äôs only dividing us. Open your eyes and see it for what it is. STOP THE HYPOCRISY. Look at what is really going on and hold every one accountable- don‚Äôt be one sided.', 'Fox News and the right wing media are out to destroy our outstanding Governor Cuomo, why are you carrying water for these treacherous ludes. We need Governor Cuomo more than ever to get the resources we need to bring New York back from four years of Trump incompetence.

I‚Äôm trying to get through it so I can have a balanced perspective, but geez this podcast is such an echo chamber and it makes total sense why the left has become so cult-like. If you listen to this, I strongly encourage you to expand your knowledge and listen to Ben Shapiro. Maybe you can open your eyes a little. If you‚Äôre a lefty who wants to confirm your bias and never have your opinions challenged, Pod Save America is the podcast for you. At least on the Ben Shapiro show he has people he disagrees with on. He even had Ezra Klein on his Sunday special. There is no way these guys would do the same because they‚Äôre too afraid to have their ideas challenged by facts.', 'Just can‚Äôt take the bias. I am looking for facts not feelings. I don‚Äôt think these guys know Thomas Sowell or Walter Williams. If they did they might be better thinkers!', 'Have they called on Andrew Cuomo to resign for covering up COVID deaths in nursing homes yet?', 'Podcast is unable to stop drooling over Trumps America.

Hearing ""supported by Facebook"" makes me sad. I\'m sure the podcast could find a sponsor more closely in tune with the issues Ezra addresses with his guests.', 'As a longtime fan of TEKS, I was repulsed to hear the Facebook advertising spot at the start of an episode.

Klein allows me hear conservative viewpoints in an atmosphere of collegiality instead of mortal combat. (Otherwise, I would only know conservatism as the dedicated effort to destroy the democracy for replacement by corporate authoritarianism.) Klein‚Äôs tremendous capacity to ask ‚Äúdeep‚Äù questions‚Äî that is, questions that have at their root a questioning of basic assumptions ‚Äî puts this show above any other interview show I‚Äôve listen to. However, the ‚Äúsecret weapon‚Äù is that Klein will be quiet and let his guest spin out their answer. He very rarely interrupts. The \nmove to the Times has not watered down the show. Keep up the great flow of opinions and ideas!', 'I have been listening to Ezra on Vox for years‚Äîconsistently fascinating conversations and a gentle listen, due to Ezra‚Äôs curious, intellectually humble temperament.', 'A lot of people wanting to learn more about politics come looking for something ‚Äúunbiased between left and right.‚Äù One of the things this show does best is explore how left/right is not the only, or often the most important way to think about politics.\n\nKlein also frequently discusses interesting and important topics ranging from our personal lives to futurism to fiction. There‚Äôs something here for everyone and I can not recommend it highly enough', 'Great at Vox, great at NYT', 'I always learn so much during these interviews. Excellent work!', 'Maybe just an impression but Ezra sounds less spontaneous...', 'Love the content but y‚Äôall talk outrageously fast in the Feb 12 convo with Adam Jentleson. Adam jabbered up a storm and you quickened your pace beyond the norm to keep up.', 'I‚Äôve listened to Ezra Klein‚Äôs podcasts for years, first at Vox and now at NYT. There is no other interviewer in any medium that I know of who does a better job of drawing out his guests, following interesting threads, synthesizing data and complex issues, and revealing important and fascinating insights. There are several pods I listen to regularly but this is the one I look forward to and learn from the most.', 'Ezra Klein is a smart guy and I generally value his analysis on politics.  However, when he strays too far outside of this expertise, the limitations are clear.  Consider his Feb 2021 interview with Elizabeth Kolbert.  He fails to adequately introduce what geoengineering really is, why it‚Äôs being considered and what the consequences could be.   Instead jumps immediately to ‚Äúwe might have to do it‚Äù.   He never even explains that the strategy he is talking about could turn the sky white, which is the basis for Kolbert‚Äôs title ‚ÄúUnder a White Sky‚Äù.  The contrast between the Fresh Air interview on NPR and Ezra‚Äôs interview should be embarrassing.   \n\nHe raises some interesting points about degrowth and the implications of a stalled political system but everything he brings up is shockingly superficial.  He can‚Äôt make the argument that he ran out of time because halfway through he switched to a) talking about CRISPR (which is somewhat relevant) and b) very shoddy evidence for extraterrestrial alien life.  He even goes beyond the subject of Kolbert‚Äôs article about Avi Loeb‚Äôs book and brings up preposterous evidence like grainy, bigfoot-esque videos.  \n\nHe may well have thought critically about the science he is discussing, but he gives virtually no evidence of it.  He needs an editor and he needs to focus.  What he has produced is more like a stream of consciousness, policy-focused, personal diary.  The Kolbert interview is more akin to what by an extremely intelligent high school student would produce.  Given the importance of this topic, this episode is not only incompetent but utterly irresponsible.', 'I‚Äôm old enough to remember when Ezra Klein‚Äôs leftist rag Vox laid off contract writers in California because the state required Vox to classify them as regular employees and give them benefits, a law which Vox advocated for until they were subjected to it', 'I appreciate that Ezra makes an effort to portray all sides of a topic, not merely his personal views. He will challenge guests to say what they would tell someone that has concerns on a traditional liberal topic or viewpoint.', 'One of the few political podcasts that give me the impression of being intellectually honest, willing to entertain different perspectives, produce new arguments, unlike almost all other political podcasts which tend to merely regurgitate the common punditry of their preferred ideology', 'It‚Äôs a wonderfully smart podcast with a diverse group of guests who broach wide ranging subjects. Ezra is smart and well informed. This is much better than other competing interview podcasts.', 'This podcast sets the standard for thoughtful, longform interviews on US policy topics. It‚Äôs consistently very high quality, with excellent guests and really engaging exchanges. I never miss one.', 'Ezra‚Äôs episode on the Senate filibuster was just excellent. Helped me as an ordinary citizen/voter understand the issue a whole lot better. Abolish the filibuster!! He‚Äôs always great at getting to the root of any issue.', 'This is the audience that believed in the Russian falsehood for 4 years.  Then in 2020 there was zero Russian interference. \n\nNot one prog dares to educate themselves beyond reading headlines.', 'Great insights into the history and impact of the filibuster. We all learned that the Articles of Confederation failed because it required a super majority (2/3) to get anything done. Klein‚Äôs guest makes clear the Founders recognized this and such super majorities were anathema to them. Kudos to Klein for emphasizing this.', 'Other than Obama of course.', 'I continue to be impressed by Ezra Klein‚Äôs thoughtful perspective. He helps demystify some of the most important aspects of the political scene. He has a philosophical approach and identifies opportunities for positive change.', 'This New York Times version is the same as his Vox show. Still as educational, fun, intelligent, inspiring.. great show', 'A little different than it‚Äôs Vox predecessor, but still fantastic discussion. Theme music isn‚Äôt as good.']"

The issues arising from not being able to not drink everyday, let alone blacking out every night is nothing close to normal and are true signs of alcoholic behavior. The encouragement of this to her viewers is not only toxic but extremely dangerous. Especially to younger listeners. They should be ashamed of themselves for talking about how drinking so much actually helps them feel better. Not being able to stop after one drink and drinking until blackout is concerning. That is a tell-tale sign of a problem, not something funny. The continuous excuses of why it‚Äôs not a problem is exactly why it is.

I love walking through the woods or doing errands in my home, listening to storytime. The selections are great, often speculative, and LeVar\'s comments after are really touching and add an extra layer of thought to the stories. The stories and his comments are provocative and interesting, and often say something about humanity and our yearning for connection.\n\nMy suggestion is D.A. Xiaolin Spires\' stories: ""Twisted Knots"" (Clarkesworld), ""Antarctica"" (Clarkesworld) or ""Nutrition Facts"" (Uncanny).', 'I was so excited upon finding this podcast! I have loved Levar Burton since I was a young child watching Reading Rainbow on PBS. And later watching Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge, as I won books in reading contests at my local library. Always creating a doorway to the wonderful worlds and knowledge that can be found in reading. A true national treasure for generations. I am so grateful, and always recommend!', 'I recently heard Levar on Bill Nye‚Äôs podcast, Science Rules! and was reminded of what an amazing person Levar is.

These episodes are short and I haven‚Äôt listed the one I haven‚Äôt thoroughly enjoyed. LeVar has an amazing voice, his selection of stories are varied and amazing, and I love hearing him discuss what they meant to him at the end of each episode. Thankyou for making this!!', 'I first saw LeVar Burton in ‚ÄúRoots‚Äù. I was in high school, and everyone, and I do mean everyone was watching. Then Star Trek, the Next Generation... but then, I began watching the Reading Rainbow with my son... it was always a special time, as I love to read and read to my son each night.

His voice is so soothing and the stories he shares with us are amazing.  Thank you Levar for the great memories and sharing the love of reading with the world.', 'And yes, I‚Äôm a millennial, but I had NO CLUE that I wanted that until LeVar said it himself in the first episode. I just found the podcast in February 2021, and I hate that I didn‚Äôt know about it until now. I can‚Äôt possibly imagine why anyone would give this less than five stars. I just hope they find whatever it is they seem to be missing. This podcast has literally taken me back to what I consider my first safe space‚Äîbeing under the age of 10 and sitting in front of the massive TV (not meaning screen size) watching Reading Rainbow on PBS. I was one of the few channels we had and the only one I was allowed to watch without supervision at that age. It was an escape I didn‚Äôt know I need at the time, and I‚Äôm overjoyed to see, well, hear its evolution.', 'Absolutely great.', 'There are so many things I love about this podcast. Here are a few. \n\n1. LeVar Burton‚Äòs masterful reading of every single story.\n2. The wide array of different stories he picks to read. \n3. Getting introduced to so many new-to-me authors. \n4. The way I get engrossed in almost every story! \n5. LeVar Burton‚Äòs sincere joy and awe of the works he selects & his fabulous pre- & post-read commentary.\n6. The nostalgia I feel hearing LeVar Burton read to me again. üåà\n7. Taking that deep breath as we dive in! \n\nI hope everyone picks up this podcast and enjoys it as much as I do. \n\nI would love to hear LeVar read a story from Jhumpa Lahiri. Her stories are just wonderful!', 'When I have long rides or when I go out to eat by myself. I listen to this podcast and the stories are just great. I would love to hear my high school fav ‚Äú The Most Dangerous Game‚Äù that would be so satisfying', 'I look forward to a new episode every week. I‚Äôm always excited to see what story is next and ready to be taken to a calm, peaceful place listening to Levar‚Äôs serene yet animated voice take me into the story! From Reading Rainbow, to Roots, to this podcast; Levar Burton has walked with me through my entire life span and I‚Äôm so grateful for his presence in the world.', 'The author gets it in a nutshell.  Our difficulties in the world really do stem from a loss of awareness of our place as only a PART of the universe, not the whole or center of it.  Our inability as a species to accept, accommodate, and facilitate the wonders of others to strengthen our world and, one day, universe as a whole may be our undoing.  Thanks for the amazing story!', 'I grew up watching Reading Rainbow. My heart is so full at finding this podcast. My love for Levar Burton knows no bounds', 'These stories captivate, relax and sometimes terrify me all at the same time. Job well done good Sir!', 'I am so grateful for this podcast! Not only do I get to listen to LeVar Burton and relive Reading Rainbow nostalgia, I also get to enjoy reading when my eyes get too tired through the art of storytelling!', 'Great selection of stories and Levar Burton delivers wonderful performances. Can‚Äôt recommend enough.', 'OMG,\nOMG,\nOMG,\nI have listened to every story read by you on this podcast. many more than once, many touched me, many did not resonate for what ever reason, but listening to you read the story still made my day better,\nI‚Äôm too old to have watched you on the reading rainbow, I never had kids, but remember the show right being on in many younger cousins homes.\nToday‚Äôs story cut to my very soul, I can not tell you why, For the life of me I don‚Äôt know why. I found myself playing parts over and over again making sure I caught every nuance,\nWhile the story played out, I never did this before, I mean after stories were over I would think about, what I might do If that was me or what I would Hope I would do if I we a certain character. \nBut today, I felt myself answering the boys questions at that counter, and accepting from the first second his story as if it made perfect sense.as if I had been waiting for him to show up and have this conversation my entire life, I have never had what happened to me today happen either while reading or listening to a short story.\nThank you completely changing my day today in a way that no short story ever has before.\nGod bless, and heaven excuse me but Godamn that was an amazing experience.', '... and that is saying something. If I told you you could hear modern stories read by the man who introduced you to a world of reading decades ago, you‚Äôd think that would be awesome. I‚Äôm hear to tell you it‚Äôs even better. The production: the music and sounds create an atmosphere that really transports you even beyond the beautiful narration. \n\nThanks again, sir.', 'As a kid I watched Reading Rainbow religiously. It was always one of my favorite shows, and I still get the theme song stuck in my head.\n\nAll of the books that LeVar read then still stick with me today. I fully expect any or all of these books to stick with me for another 20 years.\n\nThese episodes definitely tackle more mature themes. Nnedi Okorafor‚Äôs Mother Of Invention was my first introduction to this series, but I am incredibly excited to listen to the other 8 seasons. That reading in particular discusses themes and topics that you would have rarely, if ever, seen on Reading Rainbow.\n\nThe production quality is top notch. The music, the vocal effects, the accents really bring you into the world.\n\nStrongly recommend it if you‚Äôre looking for the nostalgia trip along with some fantastic stories and narration.', 'Came for the nostalgia, stayed for the outstanding narratives,  wonderful readings and excellent stories - love it!', 'This podcast is fabulous. My kids grew up watching Reading Rainbow. LeVar‚Äôs voice is soothing and familiar to me, and his choice of stories challenges my perceptions and beliefs about reality. The stories are surprising in their range, depth, and voice. \n\nA suggestion for a future show: If Cats Disappeared from the World by Genki Kawamura. In this science fiction short novel, the main character, faced with a terminal diagnosis,  buys additional days of life by bargaining with the devil. For each thing he gives up, he gains another day of life. The catch? Each item he gives up (cell phones, movies, cats) disappears from the world forever for everyone. This story is though provoking and is wonderfully told.', 'Levar Burton has a great voice for storytelling and I‚Äôve enjoyed this podcast from the beginning. I‚Äôve listened to every episode and I wanted to point out that as a white male I am grateful to be exposed to other cultures and perspectives. That‚Äôs one of the things that makes science fiction fun. I don‚Äôt always find common ground with these stories, but they are always fun and bring a little light into my life. Thank you for doing this and please keep going for many more seasons.', 'Love this show!!!', 'Levar is a gem. You will fall in love with the authors and their stories.', 'Levar- thank you for sharing such great pieces from a range of truly diverse authors. I have loved listening to pieces by POC authors from a wide range of cultures and backgrounds.', 'Levar Burton‚Äôs selections are unique and wondrous.  I never saw reading rainbow but I sure appreciate the way he brings excitement as he reads to adults.  Many of the stories selected have a deeper meaning that make you think.  It‚Äôs fun to get a taste of authors you see but never get a chance to read.  Highly recommend.', 'Firstly, I love this podcast and Levar‚Äôs voice and cadence are dreamy.\n\n That said, I often listen while going to sleep. Works like a charm, until that darn theme song goes off like an alarm. It legit sounds like an alarm tone. \n\nIt would be so wonderful if that would change. But I guess for now I‚Äôll have my heart attacks as I am nearly asleep.', 'This show really is the height of podcasting.  LeVar Burton is by far the best storyteller I‚Äôve ever heard, and when you add in the music... magic.  Thank you LeVar, thank you for roots, thank you for Star Trek, thank you for reading rainbow, thank you for this.', 'Take a talented actor, add a love of well\ncrafted tales, a nose for the finest writers, a focus on voices not necessarily being carried by the main stream, a passion for sharing great literature, and wrap it all up in a smooth, nostalgic and intimately expressive voice. It‚Äôs what podcasts are meant to be! Thank you, Mr, Burton and your team for sharing your talents and taste with us again and again. This podcast is always a bright spot in my day!', 'I love his voice, so entertaining but relaxing at the same time. I work custodial so I have a lot of time to listen to podcasts and I LOVE spending it listening to Levar.\n\n I have a request! Would you read ‚ÄúThe Lottery‚Äù by Shirley Jackson? I remember the first time reading it in my high school AP English class and I was SHOCKED. I‚Äôd love to listen to you read it. Love the show so much!', 'I grew up with Reading Rainbow, and LOVE getting stories by the same voice in the same style, but all-grown-up... This podcast is just amazing.\n\nThe one story I‚Äôd still love to hear is Asimov‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Last Question‚Äù. I think he‚Äôd do wonderful things with it!']"

Don‚Äôt waste your time. Season 4? Completely biased and racist. This is one of the worst podcasts (trying so hard to implement white guilt) that I‚Äôve ever heard. I have no white guilt nor should I. You should be ashamed.', 'This podcast is amazing and is a must listen to podcast! Season 3 takes a raw and deep dive into our criminal justice system by looking at regular cases with astonishing outcomes. The narrator, Sarah, provides her own insight to what she observed. She also adds information to the case that was not previously mentioned but is vital for us listeners to know. Such a good podcast and I highly recommend!!', 'Good podcast with good information. It is paced well and is entertaining. Listening to the episode about the young woman in Cleveland who was in a bar fight. The sex and race of those involved is mentioned and highlighted when it fits the hosts narrative. When it does not, it is passed over very quickly. One example, a female prosecuting attorney was unwilling to drop or lower charges on the female defendant. Not mentioned. When the white male attorney took over, he loaded the charges immediately. His race and sex not highlighted in any way. \nVery inconsistent to the point that it is noticeable.', 'Best podcast I‚Äôve ever. Great story telling. Only issue is that there aren‚Äôt enough episodes.', 'Binge season one with a big ole spoon. Take or leave seasons 2 and 3 due to the ‚Äúmeh‚Äù nature of the stories. Season 4?

She really needs to grow her emotional intelligence...', 'This is anti racist woke crap. America does not agree with this.', 'I know this school, and she got it right. Every episode covered a different topic, one more fascinating than the next. If you are a liberal white parent who espouses belief in integration and lives in a diverse neighborhood, yet chooses not to send your children to the school on the corner (without even looking at it), you might feel accused of racism. You might be asked to look at yourselves, at your subversion of the school choice movement, at your reasons for choosing the many private schools that opened after your city tried to integrate, aiming directly at your demographic by curating the exact number of students of color with which your child will be surrounded. It might be hard. When you hear the children, parents, and educators whom you worked so hard and payed so much to ensure that your child would never meet, you might think, ‚ÄúWhy, these children are smart, these parents are like me, these teachers know so much about subject matter and pedagogy! Why did I so prioritize avoiding this good experience for my child?‚Äù It may be hard. But it ends with real thinking and points to ways forward. It is honest, fascinating, powerful, and utterly listenable. Finish all episodes.', 'So important to draw attention to the ways our behavior or lack there of impacts minority groups. Especially behaviors we may not even realize have an impact.', 'Compelling storytelling.', 'First 2 seasons were amazing! But like many others the next one fell flat and I stopped listening. It seems like the podcast was going in one direction and then completely shifted to try and be relevant to today‚Äôs struggles. I wish the direction and goal hadn‚Äôt shifted.', 'Absolute garbage', 'I was first introduced to Serial shortly after season one aired by a college professor that had turned listening to the podcast (and analyzing it) into an assignment. And I‚Äôve gotta say, ever since then, the in depth journalism and adept way the story is narrated and structured has always grabbed my attention. I can say all of the seasons are definitely binge worthy. \n\nAnd a note about everyone giving a one star review for this podcast just over the 5 episodes of ‚ÄúNice White Parents‚Äù, it‚Äôs most likely that they fulfill that classification and instead of listening and trying to view the world from a different perspective, they‚Äôd rather continue to ignore the fact that there is inherent racism in almost every single aspect of U.S. society. Blissful ignorance. \n\nBottom line is, please listen. Educate. And above all else, keep in mind that your perspective on the world isn‚Äôt the only one, and it‚Äôs always worth understanding someone else, because that‚Äôs how we grow.', 'ﬂ®o']"

In a podcast, he can be more relaxed and naturally funny than he can be on a scripted late night format, and he can also open up about personal issues like depression struggles. He clearly loves doing the podcast and (mostly) features guests that he seems actually interested in talking to versus celebs promoting their latest film on his TV show.\n\nBut really the best parts of the cast are not the interviews, but the intro and outro segments with Sona and Matt. Sona and Conan have a sibling-like rapport and it‚Äôs so funny when they snipe at each other. He loves to provoke her but it‚Äôs all in good fun. Highly recommend their Summer S‚Äômores episodes with no guests, just the three hosts being hilarious together.\n\nGive this a listen if you have enjoyed Conan on TV.', 'I‚Äôve tried hard to love this podcast, but have been increasingly frustrated that Conan doesn‚Äôt let his guests talk.

As a survivor of domestic violence, my heart aches for them. As a listener of podcasts, these episodes are so poorly paced and repetitive without context or new information that it‚Äôs *so* boring. I feel that it also generally glosses over mental illnesses. I‚Äôve listened to all seasons, and they‚Äôre getting progressively worst in their storytelling.

The host allows her gusts to tell their stories and she does a great job of interviewing them. Season 4 becomes boring listening to her read passages out of books and it goes downhill from there. The masters season is hard to listen to. The main character labels her brother as evil and manipulative when he‚Äôs just 3. I get it, he‚Äôs her abuser but this (and more like it) should have been edited out. Come on Tiffany, let‚Äôs get the magic back!', 'Something Was Wrong was in my recommended podcasts since I follow a few true crime podcast. I‚Äôm glad I listened to this recommendation because I was hooked by the first 10 minutes of the first episode I listened to (which is Amy‚Äôs story). The fact that the survivors are telling their stories makes it hopeful. I can only speak to Amy‚Äôs story but I have to say she is an incredibly riveting storyteller. She is so intelligent and bravely tells her harrowing story of her brother‚Äôs abusive behavior. I highly recommend this podcast because of the content and how it‚Äôs organized by the host.', 'The guest just keeps rehashing the same themes over and over.  I get this is traumatic for this person and this is an opportunity to share her story, but we are three episodes in and the story is all over the place.  The timeline jumps around, the facts of this story seem loosely defined or are vague memories. It‚Äôs very one sided. Do we get to hear anything about this brother from anyone but the story teller and her friend.   I do find myself fast forwarding to try and find some new detail.', 'I just left a long term relationship for mental health reasons and needed a lot of new podcasts to fill the time.

Amazing!', 'I loved this podcast. Crime a Junkie sent me here and I‚Äôm so happy it did. Sarah‚Äôs story from season one was so real. It almost is scarier from how low key and not obvious it was. Well done and keep it up!!', 'This podcast has been really therapeutic for me to listen to. Listening to others share about and process their traumatic experiences has helped me face my own. Well done!', 'Love this podcast - not only because of the interesting stories so bravely told by the survivors - but their stories help me recognize and process my own abuse experiences with my former ASPD abuser. Knowing we aren‚Äôt alone in ‚Äúfalling‚Äù for the gaslighting, love bombing, etc. eases the burden of loneliness/unearned shame we can feel as survivors. Thank you.', 'Season 1 has a LOT of god/religious talk that it‚Äôs cringe. It feels like the main person is Michael Scott telling his quitting story. The whole first season could have been 1 episode. The main person goes on and on and nothing really happens?', 'Came because of Crime Junkie! This podcast has so much potential but decided to stop after season one because the story was drawn out & plateaued after the first few episodes', 'The only drawback is waiting each week to find out what happens! The storytelling is amazing. The hosts voice is so calming. She mixes in the right amount of educational information in each episode. You can tell she really cares about the issues and each of the people she interviews, as well as others who have dealt with similar traumas.', 'The sibling abuse episodes came across as very gossipy and dismissive of the brother‚Äôs mental illness.', 'Highly recommend! Great story telling!', 'Listen, I‚Äôve only listened to season one about Sarah and her story. \nI relate to it so hardcore, and to have this podcast to listen to just makes me feel validated. I‚Äôm not crazy like he or others made me out to be. I was manipulated and a million other adjectives. It‚Äôs just comforting in an odd way to have this to listen to and relate to- even if it‚Äôs bringing up old things for me. It‚Äôs helping me grow in my strength.', 'I‚Äôve listened to 4 season in a week! So good!!! So easy to listen to', 'The latest season (7) is terrible. The guest just talks non-stop without taking a breath. Her voice is so grating it‚Äôs impossible to even focus on what she is saying. The most infuriating part is the multiple times that she has experienced sexual assault without never actually having been touched by a predator (her brother or a friend). (You‚Äôll have to listen to understand what I mean). She doesn‚Äôt take responsibility of her own actions. She also constantly talks about herself way too much and not the story. Three episodes in and we barely know what the story is about. I wish there was actually a guest and story that could help those that need to hear it (like the first couple seasons) instead of this garbage.']"

I expect something more from Public Radio.  While there are lots of people on TV like Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, Bill Maher and Samantha Bee who excel at both informing and showing the ridiculousness of our politics,  this podcast fails on all points and just repeats things we have already all heard over and over.  Much of the time, it just sounds like the hosts seem to feel they need to talk to fill the air time even when they are not very well informed about the issues at hand.  They sound like they are having fun and doing the podcast mostly for their own pleasure and not to really inform the public in any meaningful way.. There is also a ‚Äú Both sides ‚Äú  kind of attempt to make themselves appear unbiased and it does not work.. We would all be better served if they took off the kid gloves and not normalize things that are most certainly not normal..  I hope NPR might dump this show and try to make a more professional and informative politics podcast that tells us something new and might even spur some new thoughts on these serious subjects..

We need no more fan on the flames that separate us. \n3) Frank Langfitt referring to a gentleman (Dr. if memory serves) reporting on oxygen supplies as a ‚Äúguy.‚Äù  This has become a common practice in NPR reporting. I find  the familiarity and informality of this language to be unprofessional and unworthy of a news organization as reputable and celebrated as my beloved NPR.

My hope is that these ‚Äústylistic‚Äù elements of NPR journalism be purposeful.

When something is in the middle that‚Äôs being viewed from the far right, of course their perspective will be that it is to the left. \n\nAlso, NPR reporters routinely disclose when they are reporting on someone or something that is tied to funding, sponsoring, or underwriting NPR in some way so as to avoid any appearances of potential favoritism within reporting. The efforts to maintain journalistic integrity are constantly on display if you are familiar with the basic tenets of journalism. \n\nKeep up the great work, NPR Politics Podcast!!!', 'Political ‚Äúnews‚Äù with a leftist slant, recommend listening to this alongside a right-leaning pod like Potomac Watch to get a balanced perspective. Shameful that they present themselves as unbiased, especially since they are funded by our tax dollars. Tamara Keith is the worst offender in this regard; her ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù consistently comes across as biased, opinionated commentary. I would consider donating if this podcast began presenting a more fair, balance perspective, but the hosts all appear to be lost in their own echo chamber.', 'Firstly, for those of you who think NPR is funded by the US taxpayer, please note that only 2% of operating costs are from government sources, and that tiny portion comes from grants that they have to compete for.  98% of the money required is provided through listener donations and underwriting.  Don‚Äôt get it twisted.  If you don‚Äôt believe me, look it up.  If your news source doesn‚Äôt admit when they get something wrong, its not news, it‚Äôs propaganda.  NPR sounds left to some only because they‚Äôve been marinating in right wing distortions and lies for way too long.  The truth is just the truth - it‚Äôs neither left nor right.\n\nMoving on.  I listen to this podcast every week.

The republicans are prejudiced against people of color and yet they support Them, I don‚Äôt understand?. Your coverage of the transition of power and why who was picked is insightful. Meeting them and then hearing them describe what they are doing really gives me hope that the Government will again move forward. I am retired now and I have been doing campaigning to save the planet all my life. They are finally getting a good understanding of what I have worked for and taking action.

The catalog of extra episodes is a fantastic idea and one that I‚Äôve appreciated so much over the last couple months of continued pandemic isolation (and new baby life!). Second, Gillian and Patrick bring a remarkable empathy and humor to some truly dark topics. It is a hard balance to strike and they do it remarkably well. Lastly, I‚Äôm so sick of seeing other podcast reviews giving 1 star, b/c people don‚Äôt like a podcaster‚Äôs voice. We all have our own unique way of expressing ourselves. It‚Äôs one of the things that make podcasts so fun! If you don‚Äôt like someone‚Äôs style, then fine, don‚Äôt listen. But also, stop tearing them down for a style that makes them unique.

But it seems like over time the hosts are so thrilled about their success they amplify what they think people like.  Gillian isn‚Äôt as funny as Patrick thinks she is, and so the huge bursts of high pitched laughter are..... a bit much.  And when they talk about intolerance and acceptance, they can also be a bit judgey themselves.  Also, there are a few times when Gillian states something as fact, when it is not at all true.  Maybe do a quick google if you are going to stay hard and fast on something.  And the whole ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Italian, I know mob stuff, I can‚Äôt talk about my family‚Äù is old.

The surprise extra Unsolved Mysteries eps were the BEST gift (pleeeease keep em coming, Netflix ü§û).  I don‚Äôt agree with them 100% of the time, but the same goes for my friends and I still love them, too. Patrick was born to scream-laugh, so if that doesn‚Äôt bring you joy, move along.

There are other views, and just because someone has the right to a view that Patrick and Gillian don‚Äôt agree with, doesn‚Äôt automatically make them garbage. Politics is its own topic entirely.

You have sincerely changed my life for the better!', 'I want to like Tim Ferris. The four hour work week was, in theory, inspirational back when it was released. \n\nBut I found it full of shortcuts, tricks and bs manipulation suggestions for how to get ahead. \n\nSince then Ferris has promoted himself into becoming a ‚Äúself-help‚Äù guru. \n\nBleh. \n\nHe interviews guests by talking about himself too much. Overall, he reminds me of a whiny crybaby. \n\nIt‚Äôs too bad, because there are sparks of potential from an occasional interesting guest or topic.', ""I've been listening since 2014 and still loving it. I've learnt so much from the podcast and all the rabbit holes I've been sent down through different guests recommendations.

They just tell the story as it happened, and I love how much respect that shows for the victims they are talking about. Other true crime podcasts I can‚Äôt listen to because the narrator(s) are giggling the whole time or drinking which is just kind of a weird way to present the subject at hand.

Sounds great, right? Maybe for some, but this also seems to have robbed the podcast of its luster. In other words, Casefile has relegated itself to a PG-13 rating. One recent episode was based solely on a stolen thoroughbred racehorse.

However, I would love to hear a wider variety of peoples experiences. I mean, once you've heard one privileged white millennial's story, you've kind of heard them all. Same goes for stories about businesses about a cracker, a cookie, a granola bar. It's just redundant and that time could be used to highlight something different. It would be especially useful to hear the business stories from people who didn't start with much at all, like immigrants such as myself and others who have a less easy path.

So many details that point to Pam and so many details missed by law enforcement.  Tunnel vision at its finest.', 'Keith Morrison has such a fantastic and soothing voice, but the tone and cadence he‚Äôs using to tell this story is an odd choice for something real and serious; takes me out of the moment every time he speaks. It‚Äôs weirdly whimsical, like narrating a dramatic fairy tale or telling a bedtime story to a child.', 'So I listened to this entire show more than once to make sure I was gathering the details correctly. We all know she killed that poor man to try and cover up past actions, but as I listened over and over there was and is no doubt in my mind that she also killed her mother and her ‚Äúfriend ‚Äú. Both if which I believe is as for money and only money. She‚Äôs evil. A person who only cares about herself and the hell with everyone else. I hope you have more of Pam‚Äôs story to come because there are still two unresolved deaths. Great job on Datelines part as usual . No one yells a story better than Dateline. Thank you for all your great work.', 'She sounds manipulative and calculating like my blood sister. Terrible person', 'I love Keith Morrison so I may be bias. But this is a good listen, similar to dateline shows but more detailed.', 'If you‚Äôre a fan of the sensationalized, cheesy, slightly inappropriate and borderline tabloid-style journalism many of us remember nostalgically from the 90s, this is right up your alley. There‚Äôs all of the melodramatic deep-voiced hyper seriousness, shot through with strangely tongue-in-cheek moments that awkwardly trivialize an extremely disturbing subject. Ultimately this is the story of a woman with a major mental illness who  slaughtered two (possibly three) people. But if you can put all that aside and enjoy the weird wink-wink nudge-nudge approach to the narrative, it‚Äôs pretty entertaining.', 'That music- nice choice.', 'I have always enjoyed listening and watching the stories that Mr. Morrison tells, I can‚Äôt wait for the next one!', 'Appreciate anything Keith Morrison touches.

Good production (perfect sound) and a pleasant narrator.', 'This was an interesting (real) story, but the production was over the top. The narrator‚Äôs voice was almost at a parody level with the dramatic intonation, and there were just too many set ups like ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt believe what happened next,‚Äù and ‚Äúwe never ever could have expected this next twist.‚Äù It‚Äôs a pretty riveting story - let the build up be a little more subtle and it would be better.', 'Binged in one day!!', 'Sad story but this pod is very well done... streamlined storytelling, compelling and well worth the listen if true crime is your thing. Keith Morrison is a pro.', 'Please out out more narrated by Keith please please', 'There are much better podcasts to listen to than this one, which I found entertaining but not especially compelling. Enjoyable enough to want to listen to all episodes, though.', 'I was obsessed with this podcast.', 'Keith Morrison does an outstanding job with his narration!

I wish people (in_new_jersey) hadn‚Äôt written about the story in their review so you don‚Äôt ruin it for other people. üòí like really? Some people actually read reviews just to know if it‚Äôs good (hence the review part) not the freaking details of the story.', 'Keith Morrison is an excellent story teller and I have been watching and listening to him for years!! Nobody tells a true crime story like him! Keep them coming', 'If you are a true crime fan, this podcast is just what you‚Äôre looking for. It‚Äôs the perfect formula for an entertaining and mysterious story. Highly recommended', 'The story is well written; it‚Äôs engaging and really holds your attention. But the best part is Keith‚Äôs masterful storytelling. Wouldn‚Äôt be the same without him.', 'The case was interesting enough without Keith Morrison over emphasizing certain words and false drama. The lesbian twist could be seen from 10 miles away and yet he acted like it was so far-fetched and that he would‚Äôve never seen it coming. If the story is interesting enough you don‚Äôt need fake emotion in your voice to narrate.', 'I‚Äôm confused by the low star reviews complaining about Keith Morrison‚Äôs narrating. These people must not watch or now listen to Dateline. This is an extremely well researched podcast as you‚Äôd expect with high quality production value. Keith Morrison does what he does best which is turn a tale. I appreciated the more personal approach they took with the other contributing producers and reporters speaking in the episodes on their experiences. This case is pretty crazy much like Pam and I was totally hooked.\n\nSPOILER: Have to say here though that Leah Askey is incredibly unprofessional and sent an innocent man to prison leaving a murderer to kill again. She wasn‚Äôt fit for her position. The police involved should also be looked at for their corruption in this case and likely others. Shoddy police work and handling of this case by the state/judge and likely criminal.']"

As such, it was hard to accept at the time that a man whose humanity appeared to be so apparent in this films could be guilty of the accusations made against him in the early 90s. The cultural discussions of gender, sexual harassment, and examination of coercing, grooming, and power dynamics in the past 30 years have opened the door for reappraisals of past accusations in the hope injustices can be addressed and the lives of those affected can find some peace.

I think my favorite video from him is his Unplanned movie review because of the points that he makes about the filmmakers and abortion in general. However, on some more minor issues, he tends to make illogical statements. \n\nOn a recent episode he failed to see a difference in AOC‚Äôs statements ‚Äúthese are the tactics of abusers‚Äù and ‚Äúor rather, these are tactics that abusers would use‚Äù. If AOC didn‚Äôt correct herself, it would sound like she was accusing republican members of Congress of being abusers. It‚Äôs petty, I know, but Knowles should have clearly seen what she was trying to say.\n\nAnother issue he brings up constantly is the CDC‚Äôs early information about masks. I think the best argument to be made is that because the CDC admitted to putting out false information in order to secure enough masks for health care workers and there was no consequence, we probably shouldn‚Äôt trust that what they‚Äôre saying now is the complete truth. Michael rarely argues this, but instead goes for ‚ÄúThey admitted masks were useless in February‚Äù which is trusting the admitted false information that the CDC put out to further an alternate goal.\n\nThere‚Äôs plenty more examples of arguments made with Facebook relative tier logic (like his answers to some questions on the political compass test) and some topics he doesn‚Äôt discuss any deeper or further than ‚Äúthat‚Äôs wrong and evil.‚Äù He does make some very good and effective points, but I believe the minor issues are too frequent for him to be considered a reliable source of information.', 'Knowles, how could you not challenge Ted Cruz when he went Judas on Donald Trump?

I feel it is irresponsible to consistently lean politically. The listener should not perceive a leaning in either direction... if the listener can , then you Sirs, are not doing a thorough investigation into the facts.', 'Unfortunately the producer has taken what early on was a good series and just turned it into leftist talking points.  This week we learn that the rejection of disco music was wait you guessed it because of a white culture backlash.  \n\nShow used to be perfect for long road trips.  Add me to the unsubscribe list.', 'Great show.

He‚Äôs the only liberal I listen to.', 'And here is my honest take: Tim claims to be a balanced reporter and I initially took him at his word, but after listening for 3 weeks he‚Äôs proven to me it‚Äôs a flat out lie. Most of his podcasts will have negative reports on the Democrats while giving every excuse in the book for Trump and the Republicans. You can actually look through the episode descriptions and see it for yourself. I seriously can‚Äôt think of one negative comment he ever made about the right. \n\nTim will also constantly remind you that he isn‚Äôt on either side regardless of how many people keep commenting they believe otherwise. My point is Tim may actually believe he‚Äôs a balanced reporter but I sure don‚Äôt. \n\nI also find Tim‚Äôs reporting long winded at times and even boring. I did enjoy how he reports on ignored news and gives different points of view on the news. I especially enjoyed him pointing out the hypocrisy of Democrats but after awhile you realize it‚Äôs one sided political journalism and I prefer a guy like Jimmy Dore who at least criticizes both political parties. \n\nPersonally I think this guy is no different than the media outlets he criticizes. He flat out lies about his neutrality as he definitely leans Republican. Here‚Äôs a quote from one of his recent pods: ‚Äúthe left tries to recruit through fear, cancellation and attacks and the right tries to recruit through love and acceptance and...ya know, pizza parties‚Äù. He seriously said that. \n\nBasically, Tim‚Äôs positive numbers and reviews are obviously supported by Trumpists, conservatives and/or people who lean right. Anybody looking for balanced reporting that thinks this is it is either lying or doesn‚Äôt understand the concept. \n\nI got no problem with someone who leans one way or the other, just don‚Äôt lie to me about it.

He tries to present both sides of an issue so you get the factual information that getting info from one side or the other would leave out.\n\nMuch like Tim, I recommend listening to news from both sides and fact checking them. This is time consuming and exhausting, hence why people don‚Äôt do it. He is my center news source and (just due to his release schedule) I listen to him last throughout the day. If I have the time to dive into an issue, Tim routinely points out the strengths and weaknesses I also find in the issue from each side. (Kind of like its his job!).

Pool predicted Trump would beat Biden by a greater margin than Raegan beat his opponent in his incumbent run. Pool blames feminism on him being single and childless at his age (this is not a joke). Pool says conservatives tend to be strong and rugged,\n (except for maybe their podcast hosts). Pool claims to be a former liberal just to gain some weird ethos with his followers.\n\n He‚Äôs not a reporter, he‚Äôs a grifter who reads news article from unreliable sources. He complains that leftists won‚Äôt debate him because they‚Äôre scared of him. This is comical because leftists have said they would debate him via zoom, what with the pandemic and all. To this, Pool said that such technology is outside the grasp of his production team. Pool has recently joined his fellow rugged, conservative colleague Ben Shapiro via Zoom. He has also debated Sam Seder via Zoom.\n\nTL;DR: Pool is obsessed with weird culture war issues because he knows it is profitable', 'Tim you are a beacon of light in this American storm.', 'This podcast would have been more valuable if you had waited until the entire audio was available.', 'Hours of repeating the same nonsense and now after weeks of saying there‚Äôs fraud apparently there isn‚Äôt? Later bud', 'I enjoy this show when he focuses on facts and news. He does an outstanding job of identifying the most interesting stories of the day. However, the topic frequently comes back to the host, his predictions, his detractors‚Äô opinion of him, and his fascination with civil war. Lately, he has taken to criticizing law enforcement as ‚Äúoath breakers‚Äù for enforcing ‚Äúedict,‚Äù rather than law. He suggests police should refuse to enforce laws that he (Pool) deems unconstitutional. I think officers should avoid declaring laws or ordinances unconstitutional until the courts have ruled them so. Failing to enforce laws would actually make the officers ‚Äúoath breakers,‚Äù as Pool likes to call them. Being terminated for insubordination can also impact an officer‚Äôs certification, and damage or destroy their ability to regain employment. Pool has often said that there are topics and words he can‚Äôt say on his YouTube platform and reports on tech censorship.  He does not seem to draw any parallels between his support of social media censorship and police officers support of unpopular laws and ordinances. When he is willing to move his show to a free speech platform, his criticisms of police might carry a bit more credibility.', 'Dude your killing it.

Definitely recommend.', 'I‚Äôve been listening to Tara Leigh Cobble‚Äòs podcast for a month or so and following her new testament plan that she has. I have really enjoyed the consistency genuine Ness historically researched and biblical perspective on the New Testament. I highly recommend her to someone who is nervous about reading the Bible chronologically. She helps to break down and explain the context of the scripture and a easy way to understand!', 'This podcast has helped me stay on track and understand Gods word so much more. It has also given me community to talk with other.', 'This is the best no pressure plan out there! So many times I‚Äôve started a plan and missed a day or two and given up because I felt like I failed. I love that this is go at your own pace!

The format makes reading through the Bible possible for my busy life!  I just found this starting in 2021 and it‚Äôs really provided structure for us in a way that‚Äôs feasible!  Praise God for your work to bring us His Word!!', 'Reading through the entirety of the Bible is a great way to see Gods unchangingness throughout time.  This Podcast is a great way to see that as well as the deeper themes of redemption and mercy both coexisting with God‚Äôs justice and holiness.', 'I love listening to these short daily summaries of what I just read in my bible-in-a-year plan (by the bible project). Tara‚Äôs break down of otherwise sometimes hard to understand reading material is so helpful! I want to absorb and grow in what I am reading not just check it off my list and this helps me do exactly that!', 'This is the BEST podcast... reading through the Bible in a year with Tara Leigh is FUN... her insight into difficult scripture has been so helpful and I so appreciate her ability to interpret passages and give a practical application for living right now! Thank you Tara Leigh!!!', 'This app explains the word like nothing I have ever come across. I have wanted to read through the Bible entirely but always gave up. I know I will finish it this time. Thank you for the time you spend researching and explaining God‚Äôs Word.', 'As a mom of 3 littles, this podcast has been such a blessing to me in helping me read through the Bible. What happened been the most helpful to me is the fact that I really don‚Äôt have to do it in the year time frame that it is set up for. I‚Äôm about 1.5 years in at this point and am about to finish the gospels.  I just simply look to the next podcast to see what I need to read for the day rather than using the Bible plan. I have learned so much and grown so much through this process and I‚Äôm just so grateful for a simple way to both read and to have the Bible explained to me each day. You will not regret starting this plan!', 'The Bible recap has completely transformed how I read the Bible. Looking back, it makes me sad knowing how I grew up learning about God and reading his word. I never truly searched for God in the Bible. This podcast has opened my eyes to God. It helps you see him through each reading. It also helps you understand the context of the Bible when it seems hard. I recommend this podcast to everyone I know!', 'Jan 1 of every year I told myself ‚Äúthis year will be different, I‚Äôll get through the Bible in a year‚Äù. ‚ÄúGetting through it‚Äù was the wrong mindset and the Bible Recap pointed that out. It also has given me encouragement to walk through the hard parts of scripture with a friend who can give some explanation and encouragement to study them deeper on my own. So so helpful  and thankful I started this. Even jumping in early Feb!! Jan 1 is only a date - do it today!!', 'Why did you guys take out 7 of the books in the Bible? :(', 'This podcast and Bible reading app is life-changing!!! If you‚Äôve always wanted to read the Bible but struggled to get through with any understanding/meaning, this is for you!!! Give it a try - you will not regret it!!!', 'Thank you so much for this Bible reading program. Although I‚Äôve been hearing and reading the Bible all my life, I sometimes have trouble with the ‚Äúmeatier‚Äù passages. Bad attitudes have crept in about things I don‚Äôt understand, and I sometimes have questioned God‚Äôs kindness in issuing certain decrees that I find unpalatable. Tara-Leigh has given Bible reading new freshness and perspective, and I find myself looking forward to the daily readings, instead of dreading them, as I sometimes used to do.\n\nMy only complaint, and this is admittedly a small one, is that I felt like Tara-Leigh should have given more attention to the dinosaurs in the book of Job. That‚Äôs a prejudice that a die-hard dinosaur enthusiast (with a growing little herd of triceratops and similar beasts, which has to be thinned regularly and shared with the grandkids) might have trouble overcoming.\n\nIn all seriousness, though, this has been amazing. I hope to go through this program every year, going a little deeper each time. Thank you so much for making this so enjoyable and engaging!\n\nYou are in my thankful prayers.\n\nMay God bless you!\n\nThanks again,\n\n‚ÄúGwennon‚Äù (aka gwennonr, online poet wannabe)\n\n(I thought I sent this in months ago.

I would NEVER have gotten this far and I WILL finish it. With the app and then the podcasts it all makes everything so very clear. Tara I just love you and your way!!!  God has certainly blessed you!!!  Thank you put so much everyone who makes it possible!!!', 'I love reading through scripture snd then hearing Tara Leigh recap what was just read.... especially pulling things out of genealogies and confusing texts. And I LOVE LOOKING FOR JESUS in ALL of scripture! This ‚ÄúGod shot‚Äù mentality helps me look for the ways God is working in my everyday life as well. Highly recommend!!!', 'I heard about this podcast from Don‚Äôt Mom Alone and I am so glad I did. I have been reading verse nuggets every day for the last couple of years and I badly needed to study a chunk of the Bible. This is so helpful. I am part of a community of readers, there‚Äôs a plan laid out that I can follow, my lens for reading scripture is daily refocused so that I read scripture looking for my ‚ÄúGod Shot.‚Äù Thank you D Group!', 'This daily reading plan and podcast has been just what I needed to stay in the Word consistently with two young children at home. I listen to the readings in YouVersion and then the podcast each morning.  40 days in and THIS is a plan I can stick to!  It is so important to be in the Word even if it isn‚Äôt the large in depth chunk of quiet I used to have, God is still using this time to grow me. Thank you for pointing me to God in EVERY reading. He‚Äôs where the joy is!', 'I grew up reading the Bible and had a really hard time getting back into that rhythm, especially having two small kids. This podcast and reading plan has made it easy to take 15-20 minutes to soak up God‚Äôs word and learn HIS story. I always gain some new perspective and feel so grateful for this time in my day.', 'This podcast is a perfect addition to reading through the Bible in a year! Episodes are quick and efficient- giving great, solid information in less than 10 minutes. And if you want to dig deeper, there‚Äôs usually info or videos in the show notes to bring out even more from the day‚Äôs reading. \nThankful for this podcast every morning!', 'This podcast is a HUGE blessing and a wildly generous resource. I‚Äôve struggled to get God‚Äôs tone right when I‚Äôve read scripture. God‚Äôs Spirit through Tara Leigh is re-introducing me to the God I‚Äôve claimed to follow my whole life but who I so often misunderstand. Dive in. Dive into His Word. Use this podcast as a resource (start from the beginning!!). I can‚Äôt think of a better use of your time! It‚Äôs so good!', 'Tara Leigh Cobble‚Äôs tone of voice, relatable emotions and stories, and the content of each TBR episode have pulled me into the Bible like never before. I LOVE how the Bible has become so real and exciting to me throughout the past year as I‚Äôve done my daily devotions. I‚Äôm thankful for a biblical podcast I can trust is based on God‚Äôs word, and a host that clearly loves Him and His people. There is no question that God is working through this podcast to draw people to His word and His joy.', 'I have been doing the Bible Recap with Taraliegh Cobble for over a year.  It has made such a difference in my Bible reading experience.  Before, I read a chunk here and a portion there, but the BR plan has made it fluid and cohesive, every day building on previous readings and connecting to earlier books.  I have genuinely enjoyed my time in the Word and have gained so much from the daily focus on God‚Äôs character.  Thank you all at BR!!', 'Blown away by this podcast! It‚Äôs making is so simple to read through the Bible chronologically and her recaps are incredibly helpful!! Excited to finally make my way through the whole Bible and learn more about who God is and his character!', 'This podcast is a great tool to read through the Bible. A short, well done commentary on the verses read each day with encouragement to dig deeper', 'The best and most engaging way to read through the Bible.  I look forward to reading each day and to the podcast that helps me unpack everything.', 'This podcast along with the plan on my Bible app helps me to understand something that can be difficult for me to read or understand as it is written. It also give me a different understanding or different point of view. The app and pod cast are helping me become closer to God. This is one of the many ways God has blessed me though others and I give him thanks for that.', 'What a great podcast and way to study the Bible, it is just what I needed!', 'I have never read through the Bible before - having felt intimidated and unsure what majority of it meant. This daily conversation from Tara-Leigh breaks it down so well and invitingly that I am excited each day to learn more. Thank you for doing this! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è', 'I heard an interview with TLC on the Alisa Childers Podcast, and what a blessing The Lord has given us with her Bible Recap podcast!!!! I have NEVER made it through Leviticus or Numbers or Job without falling asleep, and now I‚Äôm binging The Bible!!! Love, Love, Love. My relationship with Christ is so much closer now, and I‚Äôm still in the Old Testament! Praise The Lord!', 'This Bible reading plan is phenomenal‚Äî keeps my attention and keeps me seeking Christ even through books that I would have viewed as less interesting.', 'Been doing this with 6 women in our life group this year. It‚Äôs brought much needed life to our group!', 'I‚Äôm enjoying this podcast so much. I feel like it is helping me to understand things about Gods word that I‚Äôve not understood before. It‚Äôs not overwhelming and the reading plan is easy to follow. If I get behind it is easy to catch up because the portions are manageable. Also, Tara-Leigh is a delight and yes, we are on a first-hyphenated-name basis.', 'I am so glad I found this podcast to guide me through reading the entire Bible! I‚Äôm like Tara-Leigh, I was a Genesis scholar and would always give up because the task seemed too daunting. BUT God led me to this podcast and I finally feel like I‚Äôm getting to know the One who seeks my soul. TLC just gets it, and she breaks the hard things down for us. Each day I‚Äôm wanting to learn more! Thank you for giving us this amazing gift of knowledge.', 'So thankful for the Bible recap podcast and reading plan. God is using this ministry to grow me. The mire I know him and his word, the more I love him. Tara Leigh is a humble/knowledgeable guide through the scriptures. Thank you!!! He‚Äôs where the joy is!!!', 'This is my fav podcast!  She is gifted in knowledge and sharing.', 'Hands down one of the coolest devotionals ever', 'Reading the bible was the epitome of guesswork for me, daunting and confusing, I always gave up in favor of the flop and drop asking God to reveal himself to me through a kind of spin the wheel theology that never quite made sense. The Bible Recap changed everything. Tara-Leigh has taken the guesswork out of bible reading and done all the foot work so you can get the most bang for your buck. Her podcast is a game changer and really solidifies what you just read, anchoring the message in your heart and mind. It‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for, and everything I need to make bible reading a lifelong habit and hobby. Thank you TLC for your dedication to God and your faith and obedience to bring this plan to his people. Godspeed! TBR is üî•üî•üî•!']"

She cuts people off and uses the lowest form of arguing, which is to issue the last jab and then immediately move on to the next issue, preventing her interviewee from responding.  What‚Äôs worse is that she is not all that informed about some topics and isn‚Äôt in the position to advocate some of her opinions.

I spent the episode wondering if he was the stand in for something bothersome in her personal life.', 'Just started listening to this excellent series. Swisher is a tough and sharp interviewer‚Äîusually. Played softball with her good friend Maggie Haberman. Haberman and the NYT led the mainstream news pack that spent 4 years normalizing Trump‚Äôs lies and disinformation.

It‚Äôs not the right one because the title and the content don‚Äôt match. I think it‚Äôs an old episode...', 'Seems like a number of people don‚Äôt like a strong woman who becomes impatient with gauzy talking points from the most powerful Parler person.', 'Wow very powerful interview. Love the hard hitting questions and perseverance against dodging answers. Had no idea that Mercer money was backing the Parlor space. Another Bannon ideology platform. \nWell thanks again for the informative listen, much appreciated.', ""Thank you for the interview. I appreciated hearing Parler's point of view. Which I think most people agree with. Kara's bias is so on her shirt sleeve its laughable. Similar to Kamala Harris & Joes Biden's dismissive attitude to those who don't agree with them. Parler should be kept online and available, twitter which I don't subscribe to should not censor free speech and google, amazon and the rest of the companies should keep out of it. Their CEOs are entitle to one vote, their own."", 'Why are ads interrupting the interviews? Terrible editing, please have someone review the footage and fix it, it‚Äôs affecting early episodes and makes it hard to share', 'Kara is smart, informative, well prepared and the perfect blend of humility and snark. Great journalism for the ears.', 'Despite the NYT‚Äôs trying to force this podcast down my throat on the Times‚Äôs online editorial pages, I am unsubscribing after listening to many episodes. There is something jarring and just ‚Äúoff‚Äù about the host‚Äôs interaction with her guests and the audience. Caveat: I am 63. That could have a lot to do with it. I remember subtlety and style among reporters.', 'However, I was looking for a journalism podcast not an opinion podcast. The host is SO opinionated that I find it cringey. Too bad, as the subjects are interesting.', 'Clever and talented. Fantastic f-ing job üôå', 'The rapid fire questions to interesting guests, not allowing them to complete an answer before pelting them with another question and then another does not appeal to me.

No sugarcoating, just plain truth and open minded conversation. You just cannot get any better!!', 'Ok, just checked out the Parler episode. Before I say this, lets be clear, I‚Äôm far left. I consider NYtimes to be left of center, helping lead america to the Iraq war, for example. But giving them the benefit of the doubt, I checked this out. Well, I watched Swisher try to pin this Parler app founder to the wall. I understand that hate speech and specifically calls to incite violence should be flagged and in some cases, censored and removed. \n\nBut Swisher is calling the kettle black when she cries authoritarianism at an app CEO for starting a company on the premises of providing a platform for free speech. The CEO himself agreed with her that he would personally pull certain things down, if they clearly were calls to incite violence, but Parler‚Äôs unique system uses a jury to decide case-by-case, and bravo to that. \n\nThe CEO also argued that if you stamp something out then it just retreats to the shadows, which is far more dangerous. \n\nSwisher seemed uninterested in having a real debate, and instead used traditionally conservative tactics to smear and obfuscate her guest‚Äôs arguments. It was embarrassing and lazy on her part, as she was clearly out for blood while attacking her much more intelligent and calm guest‚Äôs assertions that the whole concept of free speech is threatened by calls for blanket censorship.', 'Really appreciate the level of journalism dissecting the latest news  in an intelligent conversation and touching the most important points. It has been a very informative and helpful understanding our world of politics and busisness.', 'I listen to pod casts all day ... this by far is one of the best', 'Host is a idiot', 'New listener.

Thanks for that timely piece. Great to hear you push back on him strongly!', 'I love your interviewing technique!!!', 'I just listened to the most recent episode and it was fantastic. Even if John Matze is a bit smarmy.', 'These interviews are valuable. It‚Äôs rare these days that people do interviews that make them uncomfortable unless they come on with Kara. Great listen.', ""I don‚Äôt agree with the hostess general outlook and the selective lens that she applies to social issues. She is however transparent in her views and doesn't attempt to be impartial; I do appreciate that, no one respects a hypocrite."", 'Your interview of the Parlar CEO was amazing.  I loved the push back on the false information    You should have asked about the posts by Lin Wood to assassinate VP Pence   And how they stayed up', 'This interview with the Parlar CEO is unbelievable. This guy has his head in the sand and this jury method they have to monitor their posts is crazy - since most of the users on Parlar these days are far right / conspiracy theory kooks. And Rebecca Mercer is a right wing nut job and it says everything about this site with regard who is backing this platform! Nightmare!']"

The production of the show is on point and I would highly recommend to anyone whether you have kids or not!', 'While I enjoyed some great nuggets of info, this is so far, clearly for one type of parent -privileged, heterosexual parents. ‚ÄúOver-parenting‚Äù is real in middle and upper class communities. However, as a social worker who has worked in many other communities, this is simply not always the case.\nAlso, the first couple talks about going to hot yoga and dinner every single Friday night, and then building their own hot yoga studio in their home gym.

You should be talking about the millions of people starving globally with the continuation of this shutdown. Maybe Ted Talks should also explore the dangers of a global economic collapse. You could do 100 episodes on that topic alone. \n\nYou could be talking about how more than half of the counties in the United States haven‚Äôt had a single Covid-19 death, yet are still being forced to stay shut down. You could be talking about the deadly global repercussions of the lockdown such as loss of education, depression, suicide, rise in crimes, looting, wide spread hunger, domestic violence, ample opportunities for child sexual abuse by the people in their own homes, or the many other harmful outcomes of extending this lockdown. I mean come on, you should at least give some consideration to informing the American people about these very real, very serious, and very deadly realities. \n\nAnother topic to explore would be America‚Äôs urgent need to stop the very dangerous practice of depending on China for 70 percent of our pharmaceutical drugs.

That doesn‚Äôt mean I will cheer on Communism just because you try to depict it in a calm ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù way. How dumb do you think your audience is? How clueless do you really think we are? \n\nWhat is your purpose in depicting support for communism, while talking down to the citizens of your own free country? \n\nWhy would you release an episode like this?

I learned that to effectively argue an issue, it works best to slow down and formulate the response you want to convey instead of trying to get the words out quickly. I learned that it isn‚Äôt necessary to back away from your ideas simply because someone is attacking your point. I learned kindness and consideration for other speakers. Jordan is a lovely person, one I would love to have as a friend. Since that is unlikely, I will settle for listening to him speak and reading his books. Love the podcast!', 'Either he‚Äôs a very smart guy who understand the logical inconsistencies in what he‚Äôs saying, or less likely, he actually believes his own nonsense.

Thank you for all of your hard work!', 'Listening to Dr. Peterson has changed my life in so many ways. The main thing he did was help ignite my love for learning and reading once again. As a young child I used to love to read. At some point life got in the way. After many hardships and catastrophes I found my way to Dr. Peterson and I purchased many of the books from his recommended list as soon as I could which ended up being this past Christmas. In the 6 months since I‚Äôve been listening to Dr. Peterson, I‚Äôve read 14 books (including some from Dostoevsky, Jung, Solzhenitsyn, and a tad of Nietzsche). The Dr. didn‚Äôt do the work for me be any means but he served as a light to guide me to the path I needed to be on. I‚Äôve reawakened my faith, my hunger for knowledge, and my romantic life is far more fulfilling. A year ago I was in such a dark place and I didn‚Äôt know if I was ever going to get out. The point is when confronted with malevolence and chaos I chose to chop up the primordial snake and make the world out of it. Dr. Peterson taught me that and I am forever grateful. I hope that the next time life throws an intimidating challenge my way I retain all that I have learned along the way. Thank you for your work. I hope you and your family are well in these trying times.', 'Very grateful for your return.

Enjoyed the perspective, knowledge,and generosity of spirit in this exchange and will listen again', 'Read Maps of Meaning (Audio book actually, all 45 something hours worth - and worth every second). Maps of meaning was a fortunate read ahead of the need, and primed me back in Feb 2020 to survive the rest of that summer with clarity and perspective. 12 Rules is of course a good read too, but less so. This podcast is a gem. Just finished The Matthew McConaughey episode. Thankful Jordan is back to interviews and enjoyed this episode, to see how others have been inspired by JP‚Äôs lectures and books. While a pop culture piece, this is a valuable and great episode to send to potentially distracted friends and family, to see if they may like a dive into the waters of the JP pool. Thanks Mikhaika for all the work you‚Äôve done in the last couple years to see JP back into the groove. What a great team. I look forward to all the episodes this year!', 'I will stipulate that there are few intellects on par with Jordan and far fewer with the breadth and depth of practical clinical psychological practice. Having so stipulated I would also note that interviewing other intellectuals requires allowing them to finish their thoughts. I felt several times that Douglas Murray was about to shed more light on a subject of interest when he was interrupted or led off by the host. Lecturing is one skill that JP excels, interviewing not so much.', '‚Äú Jordan Peterson‚Äôs popularity is the sign of a deeply impoverished political and intellectual landscape‚Ä¶‚Äù -Nathan Robinson.', 'One of the best, if not the best take on the current political state. Very well thought out and intellectually honest. Refreshing.', 'I have listened to every available minute of Jordan Petersen‚Äôs lectures. He has changed my life!!! I was introduced to Douglas Murray with the Sam Harris debates. He‚Äôs great, I love his point of view. Towards the end of this Jordan claims something like 90 court cases have been brought to the courts and only one of them have been held up. He uses that as proof that there is nothing about the election that Trump supporters should be wary of. It‚Äôs as if he‚Äôs sayingTrump lost get over it and that we should just happily move into the new Biden administration and basically keep our concerns to ourselves. Maybe  a suggestion to be the bigger person to help end the polarization. My main concern is Bobulinski an American citizen that came forward with a credible story that should‚Äôve been investigated was decidedly withheld.  Citizens should‚Äôve been allowed to hear the content, to help inform their decision about the next President of the United States. The votes in Georgia Philadelphia and Michigan were within thousands of votes of millions of votes cast. If the Bobulinski story, which was withheld from the public by social media. Side note I consider Social media an institution of America! One of the institutions that Jordan claims is in great shape, which molds the minds of the American people. Social media and mainstream media completely disregarded information, and chose what information was available. My claim is that the thousands of votes that determine the election would have been changed if social media and the mainstream media didn‚Äôt coordinate to obscure a relevant piece of information that the voters never had a chance to review.  Lastly democrats claim that the 2016 election was affected by Russian interference.  I say that the 2020 election had more interference with it than any kind of interference from the Russians. They were allowed to bring about their conspiracy theories for four years. Republicans are being told to shut up after a couple of months. I love Jordan Petersen I just think he isn‚Äôt considering my point of view as a Trump Supporter.  My frustration is the election was stolen by coordination of top democratic leaders, social media, and mainstream media.', 'Thank you Dr. Peterson for your wonderful insights. I‚Äôm looking forward to your new book in March... run don‚Äôt walk to get his new book!!!!', 'I have long very much enjoyed listening to the discussions. I would just say when really delving into US politics, that you cannot get to many, if any, core aspects of today‚Äôs situations without qualifying such things in the context of what has been going on on the Left. The left has been leading the discussion and acting as the constant push towards this or that next thing for decades at least. The republicans are in perpetual response mode to reign in as much as possible all these perceived reckless leaps too far forward. What the conservative voters in this country are doing is also in response to such things, but now many have grown tired of conservatives not fighting back with much success. The train of the left may be slowed down but it is never overturned. Conservatives are tired of constantly having to readjust to the new realities of life in America imposed on them by the Left. This conversation with Douglass Murray too often talked about some of the wrongs of voters on the right such as the riots, or the ways in which conservatives are veering into unwise ways in a vacuum. You cannot possibly get it right if you don‚Äôt put forth the forceful authoritative actions of the left as the backdrop against which conservatives are acting.', 'The lies, the false equivalencies, the Alt right snake oil snakesmen. A 7 million vote margin for Biden. is not a close election despite your lies.', 'Conservatives must not get lost in the fog of war.', 'Love JP‚Äôs lectures and direct talks. The ‚ÄúRogan‚Äù interview approach is not why I subscribe here. The interviews are fine, but definitely silver compared to the gold of prof P‚Äôs teachings. Rogan is listened to for the lens he places on others. That‚Äôs his gold. I wouldn‚Äôt tune in to Rogan to hear his lectures (if he gave them). That‚Äôs Not his talent. The reverse is true here. I‚Äôm looking forward to lectures on the new book and less of this trend toward interviews. Sorry mr Peterson, we are looking for your thoughts, let joe do the interviews.']"

I am deeply appreciative to all those that put this together each week!', 'This dude is obsessed with meditation', 'Dan‚Äôs interview skills are excellent and the guests always provide great takeaways that we can apply to our own lives.', 'Absolutely one of my favorite podcasts.', 'This is a great podcast, one of my favorites.   I always learn something new.', 'Love the podcast, love the app. The book is next on my list.', 'Great perspective!  I‚Äôm 69 years old and retired a month before COVID because of health reasons.  I am an ‚ÄúA‚Äù type person used to working on legal cases,  cooking, cleaning, traveling, etc.  In March 2020 it all went away.   Because of my health issues, I‚Äôm forced to sit or lie down a lot.  It‚Äôs caused me to feel pretty worthless, and being detached because of COVID has only added to the frustration and despair.  This podcast provides an excellent perspective and has given me much to think about and approach things in a different manner.  Thank you so much for these podcasts as they have been a true game changer ‚ù§Ô∏è', 'I love listening to the podcast. I‚Äôm hooked. Downloaded the app and have begun meditation.

I found it in the spring of 2020.  I find every episode inspiring.  The podcast led me to the Summer Sanity Challenge which then helped me get back into a regular meditation practice after a year of failed attempts.  I consider the Ten Percent  family to be my sangha.', 'Loved the episode with JoAnna Hardy and the meditation she shared on resetting your nervous system.

I get a lot out of the Ten Percent Happier app too. I‚Äôve enjoyed the 21 day meditation challenge.', 'I am an on/off listener but have been especially impressed by recent content vis-a-vis the difficult period following the elections. Loretta Ross and Jon Kabat-Zinn episodes along with the New Year‚Äôs episodes were so spot on. I echo other reviewers‚Äô praise of Dan - he is such a skilled interviewer, giving space for others to share their knowledge, prompting clarifications, inviting deeper dives, and asking thoughtful questions that elevates the already great content of what experts have to share. Thank you!', 'Dan Harris understands the value in letting his guesses talk freely with limited interruption or redirecting them to fit his agenda.', 'This year has been a challenge, but the best thing to come out of it is a regular meditation practice thanks to 10% Happier. The podcast, the app, and the book have all been monumental in maintaining my mental health and happiness, and finding joy in life. I highly recommend this to anyone who has a remote interest in meditation. The benefits are immediate. Thank you for all that you do at TPH!', 'So glad you interviewed Loretta Ross in this moment!', 'I appreciate Dan‚Äôs preparation for his interviews (even though I assume he has a great team supporting him in that - he is still the front man and very much in the present when interviewing someone). He does a very good job of fleshing out the salient points of interest, digging deeper at all the right times and not wasting time on areas that are (at least in my mind) less important. I appreciate that he follows up, defines terms, identifies people and places, and never forgets ‚Äúus listeners‚Äù in terms of making sure we have good, clear explanations.  Great podcast. Would love to hear more from TM meditators which is my current method of practice. Also, would be great also to have a written index of all the books, places or people mentioned during a podcast interview in case we want to read further or follow up on a reference. At any rate, thanks for all the hard work. I have learned a lot, and I always look forward to Wednesdays for the posting of new episodes.\n\nUPDATE 9/2019:\n\nOMG. Joseph Goldstein - Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I have replayed it 3 times. Also, I cast a very emphatic vote of YES for his suggestion of a ‚ÄúBuddhist Corner‚Äù on the app. Please do that without delay.\n\nUPDATE 1/2020:\n\nTara Brach interview was amazing, and thoughtful. Much appreciated.\n\nUPDATE 10/20/20: \n\nI love Tuere Sala and her presentation of Mudita. I love how she stuck hard to her interpretation and definition of this term and pushed Dan beyond what it appeared was his understanding of it. It seems she is saying compassion is to suffering as mudita is to joy. Would love to hear more from her and specifically how to ‚Äúembody‚Äù joy. Would also love to hear her and Lama Rod Owens collaborate to say more about how to (physically) em-body joy. Great episode.\n\nAlso, the entire election series was amazing, helpful and enlightening, particularly the ending with Roshi Joan Halifax and I am going to include DaRa Williams in that, as well. All five women were outstanding.  What a collection of enormously big-hearted and brilliant women.\n\nUPDATE 1/17/21:\n\nThe Jack Kornfield episode (A Big Dose of Perspective) was outstanding. I always feel more hopeful after listening to Jack.  His answer to the question raised by the caller who identified herself as a ‚ÄúCOVID nurse‚Äù was beyond wise and so compassionate and thorough; he identified and addressed all the nuance in what she asked and expressed. And, like Jack, I was also moved by the caller, herself...how amazing that she works all day in that difficult environment and then returns home carrying the weight of the worry for her young children and expresses it in such a thoughtful way...so many millions of parents are of course doing the same but those who are frontline workers have that extra raw component of seeing, firsthand, the pain that the rest of us do not. I concur that she and all her colleagues deserve our deep and profound gratitude. Anyway, another fantastic episode by Dan and his team for sure.', 'I really enjoyed his perspective‚Äôm', 'Yes! Yes!! Yes!!! This is exactly what I need right now. All I can say is, Thank you Sir may I have another!', 'Dan I listen to all your podcast episodes and use the Ten Percent Happier app. The episode with Jack Kornfield (the week of January 11) is by far one of the best episodes I have ever heard on this or any other podcast. It helps restore my faith in humanity and gives me a roadmap to  equanimity in today‚Äôs troubled world.', ""I've listened to at least a hundred 10% Happier episodes and it's one of my favorite podcasts. Dan's a veteran journalist, which probably has a lot to do with why he's such a standout interviewer--respectful, inquisitive, humorous, and sometimes skeptical. I think every major US meditation teacher has been on the show, many of the best multiple times. As a psychologist involved in research, I also appreciate his and his guests' science-based approach to meditation practice and wellness, with reasonable expectations for what any practice can deliver and lots of useful advice.  Many guests are leading researchers in psychology and related fields. Not to sound like a commercial, but if you want to be entertained, support your meditation practice and live a 10% better life, give this podcast a listen."", 'Thank You for Jon Kabat - Zinn . You moved in real time to address fear and sorrow. I am displaced out of NYC due to job loss. My Mother is doing Hospice at home. It is imperative that I maintain balance and humor. I listen to Ten Percent to remind myself of the collective consciousness for good. My Mother is 94 and a brainiac. I rely on great teachers to support my path and remind myself there is dharma everywhere. Thank You...Emerson Grad I appreciate your reporter mind.', 'I‚Äôve recently started working on Intuitive Eating due to a Binge Eating Disorder. I came across this episode while researching and am so happy I did. Dan was so honest about his thoughts on food and everything he asked is how I feel. Thank you for sharing! And for bringing a new Podcast into my life. Can‚Äôt wait to listen to more episodes and download the App!', 'I love this podcast and am a big longtime fan of Dan Harris. The show always has great guests (especially Joseph Goldstein) and I enjoy Dan‚Äôs vulnerability and examples from his own experience. \n\nI do have one complaint: whenever Dan mentions Al Franken (which he does OFTEN because he loves to mention his Stewart Smalley SNL character) he always says ‚Äúdisgraced Senator‚Äù or something like that. Dan, could you please just call him Senator Franken or ‚Äúformer Senator‚Äù if you prefer and leave out the ‚Äúdisgraced‚Äù bit? Everyone knows that part and you don‚Äôt have to say it literally every time you mention him. He had a distinguished career in the Senate, and he deserves better than to be summed up that way.', 'I LOVE listening to Dan as he is so grounded and real. His guests are by and large equally as intelligent and captivating. I truly look forward to this podcast every week!', 'I haven‚Äôt listened to this and don‚Äôt plan to.  I do however find it offensive that he is exploiting what should be a personal journey through inner thoughts and making it a sales gimmick with a catchy phrase.  Best of luck making money on what should have nothing to do with profit.', 'Fabulous and thoughtful choice of guests. I always learn something and leave feeling that I can improve in ways that don‚Äôt make me feel like I‚Äôm flawed for needing to improve. I only wish there was a tiny bit less of Dan‚Äôs personal experiences in every show. Still, so worth listening and subscribing to.', 'Come listen to a bunch of affluent people pat themselves on the back for meditating their way out of their affluent problems. You‚Äôll be so, so proud of them, and that‚Äôs what this podcast is all about', 'Great interviewer. Let‚Äôs the guest talk, tho Dan‚Äôs knowledge and insights are very informative. He asks excellent questions, moves the interviews along and doesn‚Äôt interrupt like other podcast hosts!', '‚ÄúWhen the student is ready, the teacher will come‚Äù is something I have been holding onto for the past two years as I began a solo meditation practice, but needed some support a guidance.    Not so easy to get when you live in a rural area, and multiple responsibilities and constraints make longer retreats challenging.   Luckily, a ‚Äúteacher‚Äù came in the form of the Ten Percent Happier family of programs.  After listening to many of the wonderful conversations on the podcast I asked for the APP as a gift, and have not been disappointed with either.   The excellent teachers and talks, the guided meditations were just what I needed when my energy to keep this going was starting to fade.  In the end, I was lucky enough to have not just one, but many teachers come into my life.   Thank you!']"

No! I, who don‚Äôt like ads any better than the next person, absolutely love Malcolm‚Äôs reads! He tells a story and halfway through you forget it‚Äôs an ad because you want to hear more. Take All Clad. It starts with sibling rivalry, there‚Äôs a gift that‚Äôs possibly an insult, and ends with a disclaimer from Malcom‚Äôs brother. It doesn‚Äôt take a genius to understand that there‚Äôs something besides advertising going on. Sure, Malcolm is entertaining you. After all, commercials are a necessary evil so you may as well make it as painless as possible. But wait. There‚Äôs more. He‚Äôs amusing himself! How far can I go before the advertiser says, ‚ÄúWait! This is hardly about us at all! You don‚Äôt even hear the company name until the ad is almost over!‚Äù My bet is he hasn‚Äôt reached that point yet but he‚Äôs hovering.

He brings so many things to my radar that I wouldn‚Äôt be aware of otherwise.', 'What bothers me most about my own review of this podcast is that I am a faithful listener, and as such I should probably want to rate this podcast higher.  I just can‚Äôt do it for one simple reason: I finish listening to every podcast exactly the same way, stopping before it is over, cutting Malcolm Gladwell off before he tells me more about himself than about the subject of his audio essay.\n\nGladwell is an impulsively-curious man.  The way he goes out into the world to discover the answers to questions he asks (himself) is informative and entertaining.  But what nearly-ruins every episode is his other impulse: to tell us what we should think about these things because that‚Äôs what he thinks about these things.  As a handy example, Gladwell had a discussion about how to Democratize the US Senate on one episode, and in the course of that discussion had to insert his own opinion that having laws which restrict how the government may work is intolerable.  The problem of course is what he means is that it is intolerable for him because the government therefore cannot operate as he would like it to.  It‚Äôs fine to want to change how government works, but it is another thing to say that there should be no rules to constrain it, and another to imply (as Gladwell plainly did) that those who disagree with him are defective in some intellectual or political way.\n\nMalcolm: Stick to the journalism.  Stick to the investigation.  Stick to resolving your curiosity.  Let me make up my own mind.  Let me disagree without being somehow an unfortunate part of your audience.', 'I did not know what to expect when I randomly clicked on this podcast but it has become such a favorite of mine! The stories, history, questions asked (and answered), are put together in such a way that you end up being entranced and binge-listen to an entire season. Side note: Malcolm Gladwell‚Äôs voice is super soothing so if you are stressed out in this pandemic world right now, throw on this podcast and find some calm and learn a thing or two in the process!', 'I want Mr. Gladwell to be my house guest for a week!  He‚Äôd be so much fun and so interesting to chat with. Love his quirky sense of humor.  He would fit right in! Lol  Love all your books, articles and of course, this podcast.

That said I have one bone to pick. I‚Äôm a PhD neuroscientist so my opinion may not be representative but I wish the hosts would relax a bit and not try to incessantly insert puns and corny jokes in an apparent attempt to make the material more interesting and accessible to listeners. It‚Äôs not necessary, focus your energy on the material itself which is almost always engaging and engrossing. Don‚Äôt waste time on dumb jokes that could be better used to explore concepts in more depth. In other words don‚Äôt underestimate the intelligence of your audience.

Like I‚Äôm sorry y‚Äôall don‚Äôt like to listen to people having fun? I need the laughter to help me laugh - it‚Äôs HARD to feel happy sometimes, and this podcast really helps. Re the political slant: if the vast majority of scientists agree that something is true, but there are politicians that disagree, a science podcast is going to have to have a ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù slant because science and politics are entangled. I think Maddie and Emily do an excellent job of presenting current and representative scientific views. \n\nAlso, as a non-binary queerio this podcast warms my lil science nerd heart ‚ù§Ô∏è', 'I was told ‚Äúit‚Äôs like The Indicator, but for science‚Äù and was not disappointed!

Thank you so much for your hard work and great episodes everyday! Happy Holidays!', 'All the new podcasts try to be too cute with a lot of flirting, giggling and attempts at jokes. Jokes are good when they are funny. \nCan‚Äôt we just cover the subject? We promise not to get bored.', 'An absolutely DELIGHTFUL podcast for my daily science fix, always relevant to the sociopolitical, and the host really makes this a fun treat to listen to!', 'Fantastic podcast! Only one suggestion: it‚Äôs time to promote Emily Kwong from ‚ÄúReporter‚Äù to ‚ÄúCo-Host.‚Äù Not to take anything away from the amazing Maddie Sofia, but Emily has about the same amount of airtime and she‚Äôs just as wonderful! Thanks for being there for us all.', 'Life is full of interesting things. If you look around, you find countless amazing things, whose beauty is enhanced in understanding them. That is the nature of science. \n\nThat is also at the heart of this show. A bit-size morsel nearly every day that gives you a small taste of the universe. And it‚Äôs delicious.', 'I started listening to Shortwave since the pandemic and it is such a joy! I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve chuckled or smiled as much listening to a podcast (minus Wait Wait) in a long time! Host Maddie Sofia‚Äôs warm voice and natural good humor invite you, the listener, to pull up a chair and join in the fun! Also- the ROY G BIV episode had me rolling from some of the best/worst science jokes.  Love you guys- shoutout to Thomas Lu of the rainbow episode and Emily Kwong and Brit Hanson! Thank you all for the work that you do! I appreciate you!', 'After hearing your requests for listeners to support their local NPR stations, I wanted to let you know that last summer I donated my car to our local NPR station since I‚Äôm unemployed and can‚Äôt leave the house during the pandemic due to my compromised immune system.

One suggestion: after listening to this week‚Äôs episode (2/17) about a lost city in the Amazon‚Äôs, I thought it might be a good idea to clarify that leading expeditions through territory inhabited by local natives can be a sensitive topic to those with indigenous backgrounds such as myself. I am of a different background so I won‚Äôt pretend to know what‚Äôs sacred or not to this region in particular, but I think it might be a good measure to clarify that leading expeditions through these mostly isolated regions can be hard on locals hence why they may not welcome guests; it‚Äôs not necessarily that they are ‚Äúhiding‚Äù something.

The reporters seemed to think the story was about them, that their footage of them giggling by the water or taking a long aside about farting is charming, but they just seem inauthentic and totally obsessed with themselves. The reporter isn‚Äôt the story, and your focus on self takes away from what should be a shared focus on the topic.', 'This show painfully fell way off, aka got soo much worse.

But since Robert retired it seems you feel a need to take on mostly political/ social justice charged topics falling in line with countless other podcasts/radio shows. And you stated you wanted to change the direction in your Ted discussion. That is fine but what we all grown to love about radio lab is now gone. Inspiring a sense of wonder was perfection. That‚Äôs what brought listeners. Simple wonder without the muck of politics, and following the news. It was an escape from all that. That was the beauty of it. Your show now is good for what it is but it is not radio lab anymore. Start a second show and bring back the essence of what radio lab was. Unfortunately for now I won‚Äôt be listening anymore.', 'I was an avid listener to this show since the start. But, I‚Äôve come to the opinion that the show (and most NPR podcasts) are mostly neoliberal consent manufacturers.

I can get that anywhere, and sometimes (esp now) I just need an escape. One of those old Jad and Robert podcasts about something weird would do the trick. I understand things can‚Äôt stay the same forever, and I support the changes Radio Lab made in response to his departure, but the content is just a drag.', 'This used to be an amazing podcast... but for the last few years it had dropped in quality and content. \nUsed to be about the improvement of the human condition but is now about how the political parties who they do not agree with, have in their opinion, destroyed the world.  \nMore time is spent covering for one political party and blaming another for their own shortcomings.\nIt is now become another political hunting ground, no longer any content or concerns for Science or improvement of any kind.', 'For a good decade if someone asked for a podcast to recommend this was at the top of my list.  Unfortunately even RADIO LAB has gone political.  And with a VERY  obvious slant (whether that slant lines up with mine is not the point) in a world where we need great podcasts NOT about politics we seem to have lost another one.  The two stars are for the many amazing shows over the years.', 'This podcast used to be full of in-depth reporting on the most intriguing topics such as love, color, sound and black holes. Jad and Robert would often speak of politics, but nothing like it is now. Every episode is just a repeat of what I read everyday on my news app. There is nothing new, insightful or inventive. What once was a podcast full of lively and beautiful discussion of various interesting topics is now just another left-leaning political podcast.

I think they do an excellent job at vocalizing any questions people may have, making the topics approachable and fascinating for anyone.', 'This was a favorite show of mine for years. Unfortunately, all the fun science has gone out the window and they‚Äôve focused in on politics.', 'I started listening about 5 or 6 years ago, and for many years this was my favorite podcast by a long shot. For years I would eagerly look to see if the weekly show downloaded so I could put it to the top of the queue for my commute.  This show was enthralling, it deserved 6 stars on the ratings, not just 5. What a difference one person makes: when host Robert retired, the show did not just drop off a cliff, but fell to the bottom of a deep canyon.  Yikes, it is now simply awful. The direction you guys are going is not working at all. I will give it one or two more episodes in 2021, and if this direction continues this year, I will sadly mourn the loss of a great podcast, unsubscribe, and move on.', 'Love this podcast even if it leans left. But to completely cover a story only from one side was very biased. Everything about this podcast has been amazing until is comes to politics.

My new favorite rabbit hole.', 'Very thought-provoking podcast with phenomenal guests that\xa0shed light on various different subjects!', 'Biggest coattail rider since Brendan Schaub, Lex is boring has no personality and only got any type of fame because of joe rogan, aside from that he publishes research papers without it being peer reviewed and blocks anyone who disagrees with him.', 'Great guests and good conversation', 'Give it a try. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. Thoughtful discussion and great topics.\n\nEasily has become my favorite.', 'I have been looking for a podcast with this kind of flavor for a long time.

Lex is too humble to ever admit it but his podcast will inevitably surpass all the greats.', 'I love the fact that Lex spoke to Steven Wolfram for over seven hours. And it wasn‚Äôt because they didn‚Äôt have anything to say, quite the opposite: Steven Wolfram is a legend of our time and it‚Äôs so wonderful to hear a podcast go into such incredible depth. I had grown up in awe of Donald Knuth, the author of the monumental work ‚Äòthe art of computing‚Äô. What a gift it is to be able to listen to Professor Knuth talk about his amazing creations as well as life in general. And the list goes on with amazing discussion after amazing discussion. Brian Kernighan is another example of someone who‚Äôs book I worshiped: ‚ÄòThe C Programming Language‚Äô. His discussions of the golden era at Bell labs is so incredibly insightful and wonderful to behold. Personally it was like music to my ears when I learned that Brian uses a MacBook Air and an iMac to program. Which begs the question, where are the interviews with the great Mac programmers, like Andy Hertzfeld and Bill Atkinson?', 'Lex is a great host of long-form conversations.

I was immediately hooked and listened every chance I got through the whole show. Revolutions is every bit as good, great subject matter, tons of details and commentary in an easy to understand format. It‚Äôs like listening to someone tell you a story, with tons of recommendations on books to dig deeper if you‚Äôd like to. I can not recommend this more to anyone with an interest in History.', 'What‚Äôs not to like?

Draws you into the times and personalities of revolutionaries and life and deaths of revolutions and also provides  a refreshingly clear window on how these great disruptions in people‚Äôs lives started, developed, and affected them, their country and the course of history. Unpretentious and at the same time brilliant. Sympathetic and empathetic, and told with humor and the occasional gold nugget Big Truth. Pacing and mellow voice each a big plus.

He got better as that show progressed. \n\nNow, he‚Äôs in top form. I started with Gran Colombia and I‚Äôve jumped around. I like this show because it‚Äôs great, and because I don‚Äôt have to listen to the seasons in order. \n\nI can also pause and listen to something else between seasons.

Kudos for your treatment of this history in all of its wonderful complexity.', 'This is my favorite podcast of all time. Mike makes the content approachable and digestible for the layperson.

It has inspired me to dig deeper and learn more about the periods discussed, especially the French Revolution.', 'Revolutions is fantastic. I am self educated in history and consequently have HUGE holes in my historical understanding. Mike Duncan has helped me fill those gaps immensely.', 'Mike Duncan is on a very short list in the discussion of best History Podcaster on the web.\n\nAs an avid listener of History of Rome (I‚Äôve probably listened to it twice from end to end, and my favorite parts many more times), I actually think that this is a more in depth and thought provoking series. If you stick with the podcast, you‚Äôll begin to see overarching themes in the Revolutions of the last 4 centuries. You also see some of the pitfalls and benefits wrought on societies by revolution. I think the material is relevant and the study of these key events in history can bring a level of prescience to our decisions. The stories themselves are excellent too. Each narrative has at least one character or story line you can really latch onto. \n\nRevolutions is definitely a change of pace from History of Rome. Mike goes into more detail. There are definitely a lot of names, but you don‚Äôt have to remember them all. There‚Äôs no quiz at the end. If you really want to absorb everything, take notes‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve found that even with a casual listen the themes and stories are easily digestible. \n\nEveryone should at least listen to the American and French Revolution Series. Personally, I think that Mike‚Äôs delivery continues to improve over time, and the Russian Revolution has been amazing, but the American and French are extremely accessible and a great place to start.', 'Mike Duncan teaches about history in a way that is accessible and simple yet highly academic and educational. It‚Äôs been so much fun to learn and relearn about all the great revolutions on my commute to and from work everyday! Only wish I‚Äôd discovered his podcasts sooner. \n\nTHANK YOU MIKE DUNCAN! You are brilliant.', 'The great Mike Duncan has come through with a worthy successor to his epic History of Rome.\n\nThis podcast gives you everything you could want about history‚Äôs great revolutions, from detailed narrative accountings to the broad themes that tie them all together.  Military history, political philosophy, biography, he brings it all in his characteristic easy style.', 'I absolutely enjoyed the Part one of the Russian revolution. I binge-listened to it, as most of Mike Duncan‚Äôs other podcasts. I know a bit about this part of the world, during this particular period of time and I greatly appreciate the complexity of the material and the times it pertains to. Mike Duncan has done an amazing job  of relying it to the listener in the most  simple and concise manner possible.\nIt‚Äôs a meaningful and intellectually charged entertainment.', 'I‚Äôm going to hang on but the monotonous delivery makes it hard to follow all these details. Podcasts should be conversational he is just reading a text.', 'Sometimes as I watch the news I find myself imagining how Mike would present the info when he gets around to his 2020 podcast several years hence.']"

It breaks my heart to see the hate and bullying that Rachel has been receiving, just know that so many of us love and support you!!', 'Hypocrite', 'I‚Äôve been a fan of Higher Learning for a bit, but the most recent episode in which the Taylor Nolan situation was discussed really shifted my view of the podcast. Here‚Äôs why: this was an opportunity to demonstrate the show‚Äôs integrity by holding Taylor to the same standards to which they (and Taylor herself) hold everyone else. And they failed miserably to do so. \n\nThis take HIGHLY glosses over the situation and fails to touch on the main problems with it. First: Taylor‚Äôs tweets were beyond ‚Äúbad.‚Äù They were a documented history, spanning 4 years, of a depraved and downright HATEFUL individual. She publicly mocked her clients while studying to be a therapist, joked about recommending s*icide as a treatment for mental illness while studying to be a therapist, and brutally disparaged the Asian community, the South Asian community, the Latin American community, the Native American community, the LGBTQIA community, the disabled community, sexual assault survivors, people with dwarfism, overweight people; the list goes on. Not to mention the downright disturbing violent threats and constant use of every slur under the sun. Now, can someone grow and change after making such tweets? Sure. But if that person then becomes an activist speaking out against the very things they used to espouse, that dark past needs to be a clear and visible part of the person‚Äôs activism. That‚Äôs not the case with Taylor. She has never once indicated that she had this dark phase of her life for 4+ years, she‚Äôs never said ‚ÄúI used to be bigoted too, this is how I eventually grew and changed.‚Äù None of that. Even her closest friends were completely blindsided by this revelation. If she truly intentionally left the tweets up as an integral part of her ~journey~, she would‚Äôve at the very least alluded to them before it took someone digging them up to uncover the disturbing person she used to be. \n\nThe second thing wrong with the whole thing is Taylor‚Äôs ‚Äúapologies‚Äù, which arguably caused just as much hurt and damage as the original tweets. In her rambling initial reaction video, she BLAMED INDIANS FOR HER RACISM TOWARD THEM. She said that TWO DAYS AGO! Instead of coming off as even remotely apologetic or remorseful, she was snarky, deflective, defensive, and had an air of being annoyed she had to take time out of her day to address this. She didn‚Äôt address what was wrong other than saying her tweets were ‚Äúsh*tty‚Äù and did not have any semblance of being sorry. Her second and third apologies were no better. It wasn‚Äôt until her fourth attempt that she specifically named the communities she‚Äôd hurt, but even then she STILL neglected to name some of the communities or address the core of how damaging her past words and initial responses were. And by that point, it was too little, too late anyway. Her true colors had come out.\n\nThere are a lot of people (myself included) who are deeply hurting right now due to Taylor‚Äôs past words, but we are also deeply hurting because of her response when they came out - her failure to grasp what was truly wrong with them and failure to make a decent apology. I truly don‚Äôt think Van and Rachel actually read all of Taylor‚Äôs tweets or fully watched all her apologies (Rachel admitted to the latter), because no one could possibly defend her after doing so. They both needed to do WAY more research on everything that came to light before speaking on it. This whole thing is so much bigger than they made it out to be, and they displayed blatant hypocrisy in their coddling of Taylor. I‚Äôm just gonna say it: they basically pulled a Chris Harrison in the way they defended her. I was disappointed, angry, and hurt listening to this episode. \n\nI will no longer be listening in the future. If you want to hear a take that ACTUALLY holds Taylor accountable the way she should be, I suggest listening to the Chatty Broads episodes on the subject.', 'I love the intellectual conversations that spark from this podcast. Rachel and Van are a great duo. They educate while being sensitive and create a great environment for higher learning!!', 'Why are you so easy on Taylor? Her tweets are horrible and she managed to offend everyone. She even talked trash about her client WHILE she was a therapist/ mental health councilor. She might be vocal toward racism against Black people but definitely not Asian (who was targeted by her in so many tweets). She also refused to take down those horrible tweets, so.... what does that say about her?', 'I love listening to you all while i work! Rachel and van yall are doing great. I also love how honest and unapologetic you both are about speaking facts!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è', 'Don‚Äôt waste your time', 'My new favorite pod to listen to while I‚Äôm driving.', 'WAIT so Taylor Nolan should be given a little break because you think she has changed since her tweets? I‚Äôm sorry but those things are embedded deep within her. There wasn‚Äôt just one or two. It was a string of disgusting hate. She went legitimately went after gays, Indians, Asians, people who are overweight, etc. Chris and Rachael said nothing racist. Nothing. And here we are with this girl who spat more hate and racism than Rachael, Chris and all of Bachelor franchise combined. I love how Rachel decides who gets a pass and who doesn‚Äôt. She had 1000 more things to say about Chris and Rachael than this girl who has been an ‚Äúadvocate‚Äù for racial accountability. It‚Äôs a joke.  Could it be because Chris and Rachael are white? Could this be reverse racism? Yes. Yes it is.  Taylor is of color so she doesn‚Äôt get your unsolicited and toxic opinions, wrath and drama? Maybe Rachel is the one that needs to look in the mirror.  Also, stop bringing Hannah Brown into your crazy racism examples. The girl was in live singing a song. Not on purpose. Guess what- if you don‚Äôt want people saying the word, DONT PUT IT IN SONGS! I‚Äôm done with the double standards. I really am. Rachel, you are so blind to them and people are sick of the ‚Äúwoe is me‚Äù mentality.', 'Rachel is an amazing force of nature!

Carrillo was the first ever Latino patrol officer for the LAPD in 1971 after serving in Vietnam where, in his words, he experienced heavy action.

From personal experience as an average schmo, I spent a fortune in my early years on spiritual/self help books promoted by Oprah and her many invited spiritual guests throughout the years and can honestly say none was helpful in securing any kind of better way of coping, understanding or living a more authentic life for whatever that means.\n\nDespite what Oprah attests, that these spiritual things she promotes will not allow anyone to be her in the sense she‚Äôs acquired much worldly fame and monetary success, she seems to mean well but remains oblivious to the way life really is for the majority of people, a vast population of folks getting through it each day in mostly dead end job servitude who struggle to meet a good credit rating and are in a work force that no longer offers a retirement plan unless its unionized work or through an iffy 401k that is not protected from economic ups and downs as well as the generosity or lack of from various kinds of businesses who can choose to match employee payments into such a dubious retirement program.\n\nIf we‚Äôre honest with ourselves we know by now that spirituality gurus talk us into believing we can achieve anything, be whatever we dream to be, do great things in life‚Äîif you buy their book and follow their simple steps given to live a meaningful life. Their spiel sounds plausible, we‚Äôre hyped up and unknowingly suckered in a far too open-minded financial purchase of guru inspired instructions we truly think will make life more meaningful. This determination and belief lasts for as long as it takes to read their book and follow its purported guidance for success until real life, as is inevitable, knocks on our consciousness and awakens us back to reality because bills need paying, things and people in our lives inevitably break down (including ourselves) need care and maintenance in which books on spirituality fail and are soon perceived as useless to-dos that do not‚Äîwill never‚Äîfit into every day living in the long haul.\n\nSpirituality-type explanations and beliefs appeal to the nuvo riche‚Äînewly rich people who started from humble or perhaps very poor financial backgrounds who are trying to make sense of great amounts of monetary fortune which has changed their lives: this is the loop Oprah has remained stuck in for way too long.', 'The best interviews and motivation you can find to be your best self!

I went in thinking that Dr. Hyman wouldn‚Äôt give platforms to fear mongering like this...', 'Mark has a positive, wise, curious, and informative show. His questions elicit great advice we all need to live healthier lives. \n\nThank you, Dr. Hyman!', 'MDPhD here in emergency medicine. Really love the podcast. So many things are completely left out of medical training! Would love the show to cover radon- a toxin not often discussed. Two critiques, one: that Dr Hyman not interrupt his female guest speakers so often and two: that he not say EM is always easy and algorithmic. Agree that kidney stones are often this way, but there is also plenty of nuanced, complicated multi-factorial pathology that requires careful thought and stabilization.', 'This started as a great source of information but over time there are so many ads! It makes me doubt whether the products are really that good, or if he‚Äôs just promoting them for $. I love his books and the meaningful conversations he has.', 'Please please please let your guests speak and stop interrupting. This podcast is AMAZING and so full of important information. But Dr Mark‚Äôs constant interruptions with his own anecdotes make it near impossible to listen.', 'I love this podcast', 'Dr Hyman forfeited his Functional medicine card on this one.', 'It amazes me how much information Dr. Hyman shares freely with us every day. His back-to-basics approach makes total sense and has helped me to get on track with my health and longevity. I listen to him every day and it keeps me motivated to keep trying to live a better life. Thank you Dr. Hyman. You are a bright light in this world!', 'I love this podcast as well as Dr. Hymans books I love how he presents factual information from different perspectives that encourage you to develop your own opinion based on what‚Äôs best for you', 'I found the COVID Vaccine episode very interesting. My question is: would you recommend, at this time, for people who currently have one or more autoimmune conditions to get the vaccine? Thank you!', 'So let me get this straight. The vaccine does prevent further infection or contamination, doesn‚Äôt lessen your chance of getting or giving the virus, doesn‚Äôt keep you from getting it a second or third time,but does lessen the symptoms and should in turn lessen the burden on hospitals and shutting things down has helped? Depression rate is sky high with over double the suicides of previous years, parents are straight up abandoning their children cause they can‚Äôt cope, people are losing their businesses and their livelihoods not to mention their food and shelter, and lockdowns are helping? Go back to you mansion and stable life doc and lock yourself down. The only good thing I can say about this is the promotion of healthy diet and lifestyle cause everything else in my opinion doesn‚Äôt matter if you keep taking everything away from the majority of the population.', ""I'm an avid listener to the podcast as it always contains great information delivered in an accessible way. The episode on the Covid-19 vaccine was no exception. It is important that everyone understands that the current vaccines against Covid-19 are not providing full immunity. One can still get infected ‚Äì almost at the same rate as if you haven‚Äôt taken the vaccine ‚Äì but the risk of severe illness is radically reduced in risk groups such as elderly people, people with underlying health conditions or those with compromised immune system. Up to this point I fully agree but when Dr. Hyman and his guest tries to make the case that everyone must take the vaccine their arguments ring hollow.\n \nIn fact, since the current vaccines don‚Äôt provide full immunity it may not be necessary for everyone to take the vaccine. And perhaps it's even advisable that not everyone gets the vaccine ‚Äì at least not until there is a vaccine that offers full immunity and any long-term side effects of taking the vaccine are fully understood. It appears that those benefitting from taking the vaccine are people with an elevated risk of developing severe symptoms. In contrast, the potential benefit for young and healthy people is much less obvious. Why taking a vaccine that only reduces the risk of severe illness when it is likely that you will only get mild symptoms if infected?\n \nDr. Hyman‚Äôs guest makes the case that everyone is at risk ‚Äì even young, healthy individuals. That statement is not rooted in reality. There may be a small number of such cases but they are very rare. And let us define healthy. Are we talking about the 15% of Americans that don‚Äôt have a compromised gut microbiome (and therefore a compromised immune system) or are we just talking about people who exercises regularly and may look healthy? Or perhaps being healthy is just a synonym for someone who hasn‚Äôt yet developed an underlying disease or is low on the spectrum of disease development?\n \nFurthermore, the guest goes on to say that even young individuals have a doubled risk of dying. Even if that is correct, it is a rather useless argument. Consider the risk increasing from 1/100,000 to 2/100,000; it is true that the relative risk has increased by 100% but the risk is still pretty small. Not only is the argument useless but it is also reckless as it only serves to inflate the real risk.\n \nDr. Hyman‚Äôs guest also makes an analogy between wearing a bulletproof vest in a duel and taking the vaccine. That is only relevant if you‚Äôre actually at risk of severe complications from contracting the virus, which arguably most people are not and, particularity, if you have a reasonably healthy lifestyle. In that case, wearing a bulletproof vest in a fist fight is likely going to slow you down!\n \nBeing 50+ years, I have spent decades to build a healthy body and mind. I have never taken a vaccine against the flu and never come down with the flu. Similarly, I never get a cold. Why? Because of the diet and lifestyle choices I make. Why would I then risk compromising the investment I have made in myself by taking the vaccine? And referring to people who, like me, wants to wait and see as 'idiots' is only reflecting back on those who choose to use that term."", 'I love this show.. so informative and relevant. Please keep it coming!...', 'Dr. Hyman is very knowledgeable. I follow him and have learned so much BUT why does he have guests on? He just talks over them or takes over the conversation. We know Dr Hyman is smart. He doesn‚Äôt have to prove it every episode. Be a good host and let us learn from others. And stop pushing the Ultra Wellness Center. Being so pushy is such a turn off. Take a hint from other Welness podcasts and learn the art of being subtle.', 'I‚Äôve never taken the time to write a review for a podcast before, but I had to for the Covid vax episode. I admit that I rolled my eyes, when I saw the episode title. I honestly expected Dr. H to have an antivax approach, considering he‚Äôs a food and supplement guru, or at least he comes off that way. Instead, the episode was a science forward wake-up call. The Covid vaccines are critical to mitigating the pandemic, but not the magic wand we were all expecting. I highly recommend you take the time to listen to this almost 2hr episode. TBH,  it was a depressing listen, but in the end I have a better idea what to expect and how to protect myself, my loved ones, and community.', 'Thank you for this enlightening conversation. So much important information and I really appreciate you putting it out there!', 'The episode on the Covid vaccine is the most interesting and informative info I have heard or read. Other episodes are also great: I never fail to learn something new. Definitely worth your time: in a sea of podcasts and info sources this one stands out. \nMark: Thank you for doing these, they are incredibly beneficial.', 'Long but very good information. We still need masks people. Be smart. Thanks Dr H as always.', 'What a terribly depressing podcast episode.I only listened to about 20 minutes of this show where your guest talked about cruise ships never coming back, masks as the elixir, continued isolation, etc.  You asked him for the science on his views, which he never gave you. \n\nI also did not hear you push back regarding other methods for combating and preventing  Covid, besides an experimental vaccine. So much of what he said is in stark contrast to what you stand for. \n\nI hope you pull this episode.', 'Thank you so much for your in-depth interview with Dale Ellison on the COVID vaccines. I especially appreciated the fact that you probed and had him clarify just what ""effective"" means when it comes to the vaccines. As someone who, at age 71,  has never had a flu vaccine and never had the flu and who doesn\'t take pharmeuticals  and has no chronic diseases, I will not be taking the vaccine. I have stayed healthy all these years by eating real food, getting exercise every day,  and using alternative therapies. I\'ve read that functional MD\'s and others in the alternative medicine community are having success with their approaches to COVID. I would love to hear you interview one or more practitioners from integrative medicine or even other healing modalities ( TCM, homeopathy, naturopathy, herbology, etc)  to see what other therapies might be helpful for those of us who have never done well with (or have been harmed by) pharmaceuticals and/or vaccines. Keep up the good work and thanks again!', 'Thank you so much for this important episode. I learned much and I appreciate it!', 'Informative, thought provoking and critically important in the world we live in now.  Thank you for sharing.', 'Interesting dialogue however Dale‚Äôs delivery of his information was arrogant and at times off putting. Would love to see everything he predicted be completely wrong. Definitely spreading fear.', 'Please....your interview with Dr Elizabeth Boham could have been great but as a woman I could barely listen to it. You keep interrupting and basically man-sprained her. Stop!!! Let your guest speak, even if you know the information.', 'Thank you thank you thank you for this episode! I am recent cancer survivor - who was diagnosed at age 39. It was a scary wake up call to make radical changes to my diet. I started fasting - the wrong way at first. Eating carb-y breakfasts to break my fasts and drinking only plain water. I learned the hard way that I had to start putting sea salt in my water and eat proteins as my first meal. This episode gave me even more tools for my healthy lifestyle toolbox. I also LOVE all of your IG posts Dr Hyman!', 'Hi! I just listened to your Panic Attacks pod and was wondering if you‚Äôve heard of NET (neuro-emotional technique) as a therapy method for combating anxiety/depression? \nAlso, could you explain how someone should get off of SSRI‚Äôs like Zoloft? Coming off of a medicine you‚Äôve been on for years is a terrifying mental battle. Thank you!!', 'The info is ok, though not ground breaking. The host is super smug about what he shares every episode as if he‚Äôs invented the wheel. He‚Äôs classist and it shows. \n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for basic info on health and wellness presented in an easy to understand way, and you don‚Äôt mind his presentation, you might enjoy this podcast.', 'I‚Äôve been following Dr Hyman for a while now. I literally became my own doctor and helped my family with all their medical problems. I can‚Äôt afford to go to medical school but I feel like I can do sth about my own health and people around me', 'Ever since I caught you on PBS I have been reading everything you put out. I think I have listened to every podcast and check everyday to see if there is a new one. You have helped me change so many things in my lifestyle, I just wish all doctors were like you and your team!!!!!!!!', 'As a therapist myself I had to write something because I feel as though he may be doing a disservice to his listeners by saying that therapy takes ‚Äú30 years‚Äù and ‚Äúforever and ever‚Äù to work. Therapy doesn‚Äôt have to take longer than 6 months in fact usually the GOAL is to get people out in under a year. We‚Äôre also trained in helping people with their limiting beliefs (so not sure how this episode is ‚Äúanti-therapy‚Äù???)‚Äînot to say this guest is not extremely knowledgeable and great at what she does. This honestly just ground my gears (LOL) and I don‚Äôt think a functional medicine doctor‚Äôs beliefs and practices should line up with describing therapy in the wrong way and diminishing its usefulness and effectiveness. Seems like a pretty big mis-step for him based on what he says he bases his work on. People need and benefit greatly from therapy. And it doesn‚Äôt take 30 years.', 'I find this podcast overall very helpful and interesting. However, Dr. H needs to listen more to his guests. We want to hear what they have to say, but it is hard when they are constantly interrupted. Also too many ads and self promoting.', '24 y/o and have been listening since I was 19. I plan to listen indefinitely so please don‚Äôt stop Mark! Also, love the book Food Fix. I saw you took a photo with Joe Biden and hope you gave him a copy. Also hope he reads it ... lol üòî', 'I‚Äôve been following Dr. Hyman‚Äôs work for many years. This podcast brings you real info about how to improve your health. Recently went back and listened to episode about social media and it‚Äôs effects in your cognitive health. The best info I‚Äôve heard on the topic!', 'Tiny suggestion...please let guests speak more. Thanks', 'Most of the interviews in this podcast are infomercials. They are about important topics, but mainly discuss the problem or symptoms without offering many practical solutions. They push the guest‚Äôs book or other product if you want any real solutions to the problem.', 'I love this podcast and have learned so much from each episode! I highly recommend it!!', 'So little useful information and lots of marketing of the guest speakers product. I tune into an episode hoping to Learn something and after an hour of my time come away with very little knowledge. Unsubscribing after trying quite a few episodes and feeling the same way after each episode. Not a good use of my time.', 'I am offended by one bit of information in this podcast.  I experienced a mild case of Covid in February 2020.  I only know because I have antibodies documented by bloodwork.  I thought I had a mild sinus infection after a flight from Fla.  In this podcast it is said that long haul symptoms are only experienced in people with other underlying health issues.  Not true for me, as I have none.  I experienced daily hives from April through Thanksgiving week this year.  The podcast made me feel like the doctor was saying the symptoms were my own fault for bad health issues.  I eat very healthy meals that I cook from scratch.  I exercise daily.  Long term symptoms are a result of the virus itself.  Stop blaming the victim.', 'I have learned so much from listening to this podcast. Mark is a great host and the guests are great too. Thanks for this!', 'It‚Äôs a let down to hear people who appear to have the goal of helping others talk so poorly about folks with disabilities (particularly people who use mobility aids).', 'We understand that you‚Äôre knowledgeable in your field. But you get all of these excellent guests and you speak over them often. Ask the questions and let us listen to what THEY have to say.', 'I listened to his podcast this year during this pandemic but then when he showed himself to be political , it really made me uninterested. I wanted an outlet free from the world and country news and far away from politics.

I hate filling out surveys and they‚Äôre everywhere!  It used to be you could complete a survey and get a coupon for a free cheeseburger.  I might fill one out very occasionally.  Now, there are customer service people (like the guy who just sold me my last car or the guy who fixed my windshield) who tell me if I don‚Äôt give them a good rating they get financially penalized.  How is that making me feel like I can be honest if they sucked?  My own bonus (which is about 25% of my potential income) is penalized if my patients don‚Äôt give us 10/10...even 9/10 will dock me!

This is my favorite podcast!', 'One of the best podcasts I‚Äôve heard for navigating work/life harmony.', 'I was initially intrigued by this podcast and started with the very first season. I liked the concept, but by the end of the first season I noticed a transition into social justice warrioring and over politicized viewpoints on subjects. The other thing is the adds. I don‚Äôt care to hear about people who are ‚Äútransitioning‚Äù to another gender. If I want to listen to stuff like that, I‚Äôll go somewhere else, but I was here for the data driven reasoning. I‚Äôm disappointed in the virtue signaling.', ""I've studied a lot on procrastination over the years. I like Adam's approach and perspective on the topics he chooses because he debunks a lot of the typical assumptions and theories out there. \n\nThe Procrastination episode is a good case in point. There's a lot that's been said about Procrastination but it never felt right to me so I figured there was something abnormal about me. The research and experts Adam presents match my experience. So either he's brilliant or Ive got agreement bias, or both.  \n\nThe one thing that I'll add that I've recently discovered is that some of my procrastination is because I don't have the right info yet. (not sure if it's just me, but I think maybe not.) \n\nThis doesn't apply to all issues/specific areas of avoidance. Like why the everloving hell are the Christmas-turned-Easter gift boxes to my adult sons still not shipped yet? It's May. It ridiculous. \n\nBut.....! Whenever I have a problem to address, and I don't address it, I avoid it....i tell myself it's because the answer or data hasn't presented itself to me yet. If I can go to a quiet place (bedroom or walk or massage table) and just sit, slow down and wait, often an answer occurs to me that fills the gap. Then I can move on. I think this is where the cliche 'I need to sleep on it.' comes from. \n\nAnyway....I recommend meta-procrastination. Put off something you need to do while listening to Adam's podcast on procrastination. üòé"", ""I just really enjoy this show.  The production is great.

Adam has interesting guests, many of whom have been guests on other podcasts I listen to. I listen to the guests, for the guests‚Äô insights. One of my favorite is Esther Perel and I was very excited to see she was guest on a special episode. She is interesting, very well spoken and her insights into relationships are fascinating.\n\nUnfortunately, Adam repeatedly cut her off and interrupted her responses to his questions. It was incredibly annoying and disappointing. A good podcast host asks good questions, then allows the guest to answer. Come on Adam. You can do better.', 'Thanks!!', 'Adam and team do a masterful job choosing topics and guests.  Useful insights.  Even the ads are educational.

I believe that I am pretty tolerant and respectful of others, but can be even better when I understand the cultures and behaviors of others that were discussed here. \n\nAll of the WorkLife podcasts go into great depth and provide excellent examples.  \n\nIf you want to understand you, your coworkers, and social relationships, this is a great podcast presented with expertise and humility of the host, Adam Grant.  \n\nAnd one of the most notable features of WorkLife are the ads.

I wish this podcast had only the single host, he would be much better on his own. I don\'t know how the captain got his nickname, but I\'m certain it\'s because of his high ranking doucheness.

I of course looked for the cases I know and listened. Their banter is genuine and gives great dynamic to dark subjects. They may or may not have opinions in regards to certain cases .. but it is ‚Äútheir podcast‚Äù. Where else would they display opinions? But they reiterate the facts more than opinions. The captain is hilarious to me. His side humor is what brings light to the dark and he always circles back to make sure all the facts to a case are there and keeping us in pace. Bottom line .

I went back and listened to every episode.', 'Initially I loved this podcast and gave it 5 stars. After listening  to 30 episodes I‚Äôve changed my opinion  .Overall the podcast is somewhat enjoyable but it‚Äôs  just very sloppy and not well researched. I agree with other reviewers that The Captain ruins the podcast . His remarks generally make no sense. He seems garbled much of the time. Sometimes he  even seem to be on the side of the criminal,  when it‚Äôs  politically correct to do so. The Brandon Woodruff case for example. The kid clearly committed double homicide,  yet he  spends a good deal of time lamenting the fact that Brandon‚Äôs bail was set high and he stayed in jail awaiting trial. For other accused criminals he says  the exact opposite .The accused  should be in jail awaiting trial.  Both hosts just echo what they read on Reddit.When they constantly refer to Israel Keyes as ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, I feel like throwing up. Smart people don‚Äôt wind up in jail for serial murders. Smart people work hard obey the law and are kind to one another.Get a thesaurus !   I notice basic geographic  location mistakes throughout  the various episodes. I just listened to the Suzanne Lyall case and they constantly confuse the states of New York and Massachusetts. The many mistakes sprinkled throughout different episodes are way too numerous to list in this review. This is just a male version of Crime Junkie. I don‚Äôt bother listening anymore because of the sloppy research and writing.   Even without the misinformation and PC attitude The Captain and his weird nonsensical comments  would drive most listeners away .', 'I‚Äôve really tried to appreciate all of the hard work that has clearly gone into researching these unique stories, and I DO appreciate the passion of the hosts. That being said, I struggle to overlook the way that many of these stories are not properly analyzed in discussion. I often find myself screaming in my head that the hosts are not asking the right questions and not considering major social factors. They frequently struggle to draw conclusions about situations involving people that are different from them, especially women. The only reason this level of analysis is accepted within the true crime genre is because we accept the same from law enforcement. It‚Äôs no wonder we don‚Äôt get answers and that when we do it‚Äôs too late.', 'Love these guys! They really go into detail and cover the topic! And BEER!', 'I am so glad I found this podcast. I think the captain brings a little humor to a dark subject but I love that Nic just keeps going with the case. There‚Äôs no pausing or off topic or giggles. Just true crime at its finest. Awesome!!', 'Really enjoy this podcast. Although I am confused as to what the ‚ÄúCaptain‚Äù brings to the table besides terrible jokes and annoying banter.', 'I feel like I‚Äôm visiting with the cool guys, who have more depth than I originally suspected. This is a great true crime podcast. It‚Äôs well researched, and cases are presented clearly, rationally, and with respect. The Captain occasionally chimes in with little asides that make me snicker, but you would be mistaken if you thought he was just comic relief. Both of these guys seem to really care about the victims, and about searching for truth. They do all of this, and keep politics out of it, which is a relief.', 'My absolute favorite podcast. They stick to the story and there‚Äôs not a lot of mindless laughing and chatting.', 'One of the 1st t.c. shows I discovered and it never disappoints. Love you guys! \nGreat storytelling, with great music setting the mood. The Captain and Nic are engaging personalities & they offer interesting commentary on crime. Keep up the great work!', 'These guys have evolved into serious journalists. The beginning of this podcast was shaky. But all the shake has ironed out.

Great job!', 'It‚Äôs a chore to find a true crime podcast that catches and keeps my interest. I get super annoyed with hosts bantering, spewing their unprofessional opinions about-well everything.\nThese guys do a fantastic job!  They have a great selection of stories, and do a thorough job relaying them in their podcast.  \nI have read other reviews and it seems some people want to hate on The Captain...they do need to chill out though.  If he occasionally says something that you can‚Äôt wrap your head around why he said it-Nick takes control of the conversation and puts it back on track.  The Captain is essential to the show, they have a great working relationship. \nKeep up the good work guys!  I‚Äôm a big fan!!', 'As a fellow Ohioan, this is tied for my favorite true crime podcast.

I needed Aubrey and Michael than I knew and am beyond thrilled to have found them! Aubrey speaks with such truth and vulnerability without forgetting/omitting the strength and anxiety that it requires to do so.  Michael is perfection. He listens and empathizes just the right amount and is a true ally to fat people. It has been less than a week, and I‚Äôve already ordered Aubrey‚Äôs book, subscribed to Michael‚Äôs other podcast, and am searching for their previous articles. I‚Äôm in love!', 'I love this podcast. Aubrey and Michael are clever, interesting, and overall delightful people. I love their take on every topic and that they are often surprised by what they find in their research.

And for a short idea, I request: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so dark, my dude.‚Äù While the topics can seem dark at times, Aubrey and Michael seem to be able to keep things light.', 'Witty and charming banter between the hosts who approach the topic of health and wellness from a genuine and humanistic way.', 'This should be required listening for everyone in the universe. THE UNIVERSE.', 'Hearing Aubrey and Michael talk bluntly about problematic and dangerous diet/wellness culture is something I wish my young self could have heard.', 'Aubrey and Michael are so g.d. smart and funny.

I became a Patron; I want them to go on researching, synthesizing, and reporting the real deal.', 'As a person who has a long + complicated history with food/eating/dieting this podcast is a breath of fresh air. I finished all the episodes in a week. Funny and smart- can‚Äôt wait for more.', 'I‚Äôve never written a podcast review before despite being an avid podcast listener for years. I felt a need to review this one, however, because it is so great! I formative, funny, and reassuring insofar as it points out insane things in our culture that made me feel crazy ! Thank you Michael and Aubrey for this fantastic pod!', 'I found this podcast after Aubrey‚Äôs interview on ‚ÄúFriends Like These‚Äù and I have been binging ever since. I am absolutely hooked and love learning about the history of the fads and myths of nutrition. I recommend this podcast 100%!', 'Great hosts, well-researched, entertaining, and really makes me think hard about all the deeply entrenched anti-fat bias in our culture. Thank you Mike and Aubrey! Wish these could come out every week, but they must take a lot of effort to research and produce!', 'I don‚Äôt always write reviews, but when I do it‚Äôs because a podcast takes down diet culture, affirms my inner-child, and makes me laugh out loud. Thank you Michael and Aubrey for your work!', 'I‚Äôve really enjoyed the conversations with each episode! It is very authentic! My only complaint is that for example, with the Dr. Oz episode, it was frustrating to hear Michael‚Äôs biases towards natural therapies. It comes across as condescending. It also would have been nice to hear them briefly touch on the difference between a bogus naturopath online school (like the guest on Dr. Oz) and an actual medically trained Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine. Seemed like a missed opportunity.', 'A friend recommended this pod and I was instantly hooked. Have listened to the first 3. Informative and fun.', 'Feels like talking with supportive friends :)\nI appreciate your skeptical and practical take on the ‚Äúwellness‚Äù industry. Thank you for your truth telling and compassion ‚ù§Ô∏è', 'I can relate to this podcast so much. It‚Äôs really fun learning more about the crazy fads that controlled America during my younger years.', 'I absolutely love this!', 'As someone who‚Äôs relatively new to the anti diet culture scene, this podcast is a wonderful place to hear new info and perspectives. Much love from a fellow mid-sized/fat (don‚Äôt know exactly where I fall lol) woman in Portland.', 'This podcast is great. Each episode, Michael and Aubrey talk in detail about a specific ‚Äúhealth‚Äù industry topic, breaking down what‚Äôs true and what‚Äôs not while tackling misconceptions about fat people and weight loss. Their point of view is different and needs to be heard.\n\nMy one major qualm with this podcast is this: they often talk about how much research they‚Äôve done or how many studies exist that prove [the point they are trying to make] but they don‚Äôt give details about the studies in the show and the only links in the show notes are to pop-science summary articles, not real research. They often say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just not true‚Äù and laugh in agreement with each other, but they don‚Äôt back it up. It may well be untrue, but it only lands well if you already agree with them. I think Aubrey and Michael could reach more people with their message by citing actual studies and describing them in detail on the show instead of just talking about how there‚Äôs research that proves their point. I was turned off at the first episode I listened to because I held the belief that almost all fat people are unhealthy and should lose weight to become healthier. Aubrey and Michael disagree. I‚Äôve stuck with it to learn more, but they haven‚Äôt ever backed up this claim other than to say that data does exist. What they say makes sense, but it‚Äôs unsupported. I hope they add more research links to their show and talk about the details of why they believe what they do. The show is enjoyable and it could be really awesome if this were improved.\n\nEdit: After reading some more reviews, I‚Äôm baffled that anyone thinks this is well-researched. I think Aubrey and Michael are doing a lot to help these people who clearly don‚Äôt know what research is not fall prey to the likes of Gweneth Paltrow, but they aren‚Äôt doing anything to explain *why* diet fads are bogus. Please share the actual research, not just think-pieces and pop-science!', 'As always with anything Michael does, it‚Äôs well researched and interesting.', 'this podcast is both hilarious and comforting. i feel like it makes my disordered eating recovery journey easier! thanks aubrey and michael!!', 'I‚Äôd love a deep dive on Jamie Oliver...', 'I never actually thought they were dry.  I hadn‚Äôt eaten a cookie in years‚Äî (I was never more than 15 lbs overweight but had body image issues)..., a ‚Äúchocolate‚Äù marshmallow covered Snackwell was my holy grail treat of treats ..\nOf course since then I‚Äôm about health and wellness and healthier sugar choices should the urge occasionally arise... \nthanks for the laughter you brought me today  (and research and insight!)', 'As a ‚Äúmid sized‚Äù lady who was always drifting in and out of ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù to ‚Äúobese‚Äù BMI categories my whole life revolved around every new diet fad, bio hack or weight loss drug. I thought I was the only one who knew too much wasted information about nutrition, for example the amount of carbs in a banana or how frozen yogurt usually has more sugar than regular ice cream (dear god those were dark days). After being introduced to Aubrey and Michael, I no longer feel alone. I‚Äôve binged (ha, pun intended) every episode and now it feels like a bi-weekly catch up with my fellow diet-trauma survivor friends. Thank you for being my buddies and helping me clear my mind of unhealthy thoughts and minimize the junk diet science of the world, you guys are AMAZING!!']"

For all the talking Christian circles about the importance of prayer, I feel like we‚Äôve not done a good job of teaching people how to do it. I spent most of my 20+ years as a Christian feeling like I was doing it wrong. Today was another dimension in just being gut real honest with God.

This new season is like a beautiful fresh breath of air! May God continue to protect and bless this podcast!', 'It‚Äôs difficult to find that someone like Jennie, who has absolutely spoken great messages from the gospel and I know has helped many find Christ, supports false teachers - especially teachers who support prosperity churches. Though I don‚Äôt regret my support of some of her studies and Theolaby (which is wonderful and biblically based), I am switching from this podcast to For the Gospel by Costi W. Hinn, who left prosperity gospel behind. I hope one day Jennie will unsubscribe from false teachers who are leading people astray.', 'Thank you, Jennie! Your reminder to me that I‚Äôve been ‚Äúin my own little box‚Äù was HUGE in my road to REPENTANCE! \n\nAs I poured out my un-prayed sins to my GOD - who knew them anyway - I sensed LIGHT returning to me! I could sense the darkness lifting - very similar to the movie about Frodo Baggins - where the king is ‚Äúcovered‚Äù in the darkness of the dark wizard - and as Gandolf FIGHTS against the darkness, the King is TRANSFORMED! Darkness is forced out ‚Äò the king returns to normal! \n\nThere was a time - many years actually, when I was on FIRE with the love of Christ JESUS.  \nLately, though I‚Äôve been wondering where that fire had gone.  \n\nNow I know that it was buried beneath my own sins - which I had been allowing in my life! \n\nI‚Äôve been more concerned with MY LITTLE KINGDOM than with GOD‚ÄôS Kingdom! \n\nThank you for speaking THE TRUTH!

I have a sister who I love so much, she makes choices that hurt herself and others. I have felt at times that I shouldn‚Äôt hope that her life be transformed anymore. But recently I felt like I can continue to believe for the abundant life for my sister and the reconciliation I long for between my mom and sister. So just a few days ago I had an opportunity to talk with her. We had a long conversation and I basically asked her if she wants to continue to live her life for temporary pleasure or would she want to accept the abundant life Jesus offers(she believes she is saved and maybe she is, I can‚Äôt know, but she doesn‚Äôt feel conviction over her sins)I didn‚Äôt feel like I did a very good job talking with her, I just felt like I was all over the place and wished I had prepared for the conversation. Then today I was listening to Season 7 episode 3 of the podcast and Jennie did a phenomenal job of explaining everything I was trying to talk with my sister about the other day! So I text the episode to my sister and she listened to it! I am so encouraged that she will start to believe in the power of the Holy Spirit and the strongholds in her life will be removed. I know God is behind all of this, He‚Äôs heard my prayers about my sister and I just am so glad that He hasn‚Äôt stopped chasing after my sister. I am so thankful for all the wisdom He‚Äôs given to Jennie and her guests that come on the podcast. I am so thankful for the gift of teaching He‚Äôs given to Jennie. I listen to every episode, it teaches and helps me or shows me how God‚Äôs in the details of my life because He‚Äôs answering a prayer I prayed or even if I hadn‚Äôt prayed about whatever it is that‚Äôs going on, the podcast often times is so relevant to a circumstance I have or someone I love has, I recognize the providence of God. I share episodes of this podcast all the time, anytime I think of someone who I think needs to hear what was shared in the episode, I text it to them. Thank you for your faithfulness in discipling us, Jennie and Chloe.', 'I don‚Äôt know if I can put into words the depth of gratitude I have for Jennie Allen and the team behind this podcast.

It‚Äôs hilarious and entertaining. Covers all the news around the NFL. But it manages to do so with positivity instead of the usual talking heads who have to be outrageously critical of everyone. Must listen! Will make you laugh and not leave you feeling bad about humanity or angry that some talking head doesn‚Äôt appreciate your fave team‚Äôs greatness (or isn‚Äôt sufficiently critical of your fave team‚Äôs failings).

It is so completely refreshing to listen to sports interviews that focus on positives. This is truly one of the most intriguing podcasts out there because Pat and ‚Äúthe boys‚Äù clearly have a genuine interest in what motivates each of their guests. \n\nMy only complaint would be that I usually use podcasts to fall asleep and I think it may be impossible to fall asleep to Pat McAfee‚Äôs voice because of his unhinged excitement for the podcast.  On the other hand it is the perfect podcast for a long drive.', 'I started listening this week. Thank you for creating a real sports analysis and humorous show. Ryan Clarke interview was perfect. Keep it going, guys!', 'I really like when guests come on the show and tell their stories and views on things. I also love how everyone just says what the want it makes everything better.

I think as your best friend, Aaron Rodgers has become a true kicking ambassador for the game, and with such a legendary ally it‚Äôs time to break out something that I don‚Äôt believe has been done before. Aaron Rodgers needs to break out a punting celebration in the gold zone for the brand. With a bit of practice a team celebration could include a returner.', 'love the show! would like to see AJ on for the whole show. he‚Äôs the best part', 'I love this podcast, Pat and the boys are funny and entertaining and they have great guests on every show.

With everything happening your episodes give me something comforting to look forward to each week.', 'I‚Äôll save you a listen and sum up 85% of episodes: white people are awful, we are very ‚Äúwoke‚Äù and liberal. It‚Äôs really hard to get past the super cringey ‚Äúwhite guilt‚Äù persona these hosts put on. Almost every episode is some sort of PC rhetoric or apologizing for how history was. This is not a podcast about interesting historical tidbits, or even things you ‚Äúmissed‚Äù. They used to do some more interested topics, now it‚Äôs all very political.\n\nThere is a clear bias and agenda that is being presented. No matter what they post about they‚Äôre always VERY heavy handed with their personal views and pushing a specific narrative. They hosts need to realize not everyone cares about their political agenda. The multitude of negative reviews make it clear a change needs to be made. Part of being a history podcast is the ability to share an UNBIASED view of the past. If you‚Äôre looking for that... this is NOT the podcast for you.', 'Listening to this was like listening to the annoying girls in high school give a presentation about something they‚Äôre pretending to be experts in but in reality have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about.

Also, he wants to become a musician which he claims is the hardest profession to get into. Okay, really?? Hmmm. One of the commercials is about a nutritional supplement that he swears by. He sent some to his mother and even ""paid for it out of his own pocket."" I find this odd because why wouldn\'t he and why would he need to point that out specifically?

He is a big advocate of squeezing lemon into water first thing in the morning. Okay, fine, I know it\'s good for a LOT of things and I do it myself. However, he says that putting lemon in water actually makes the water more hydrating. I\'ve been searching for actual scientific evidence of this and can\'t find it. This, and many other things that he says, leads me to think that his ""science"" is pretty much whatever he wants it to be.

I definitely recommend if you want to transform into becoming your best self.', 'Learn a new thing about myself from your podcast every day! Keep up the good work!', 'This is an urban myth. It DID NOT happen. I believe writing your goals down is a good thing. It does trigger more parts of the brain. I am a clinical psychologist and listen to every episode. Overall it is really good. I do not claim to know everything but this I know. This study did not happen. And for the other psychological topics in this podcast, please seek out professional people to help you understand more. I like this podcast a lot but half of the psychological topics he discusses is not based on psychological research. It‚Äôs more anecdotal or pseudoscience. Still love the podcast and it makes me think.', 'Might have been decent if you did not feel you had to swear in every other sentence to make a point.', 'Rob Dial has changed my life miraculously.

You may think of design as something related to architecture or interior decorating, but this podcast goes much deeper than that.  Issues covered include the social and political effects of every design decision made for every little thing in our human-created world.  It really does a great job at exploring topics of things that you would never think of and making them fascinating.  Each episode typically has interviews with experts in the field as well.  If I could recommend just one podcast for people to listen to, this would be it.', 'Please go back. I find the show exhausting to listen to.', 'I‚Äôve learned some cool facts from this podcast and enjoy listening to it but as others have said the political message is definitely there.

Not anymore.', 'A lot of people seem to be upset at the introduction of politics into 99pi. What most people don‚Äôt realize is that politics and design are inextricable linked. The gaudy, ornate style of Louis XVI reflects the state of France directly before the French Revolution. American design has evolved in a parallel manner to her president. We are simultaneously slick and modern yet cheaply made and often toxic or dangerous. The example of homelessness in America is an example of the lack of design and occasionally the outright malicious design for and targeted at homeless people such as benches with bars between seats. Living in a car is a facet of America whether you like it or not, and we all have a hand in creating a country where we have millions of homeless and we blame them for it. We have the means, the innovation, the drive, and the design. We just don‚Äôt have the empathy, and that, my friends, is why the ‚Äúsjw agenda‚Äù seems to be present. Empathy looks like weakness to Americans.', ""Please just stop and go back to the architecture and design format.    Play to your strength.

I love listening and I‚Äôm always excited to hear new episodes. \n\nHowever, they‚Äôve launched all these sub-genre podcasts under 99 PI. \nArticles of Interest I loved, but because it‚Äôs under the 99 PI headline I can‚Äôt share it with my friends who may only be interested in that topic.

She literally finds a homeless man that grew up in the house she‚Äôs currently living, but never seems to notice that she‚Äôs the cause reporting on the effect. In the last episode she admits that looking at any potential solutions is ‚Äúhonestly a whole other podcast‚Äù. Everything in between is a lesson that homelessness is not a great position to be in, and also a large and difficult problem. It presented itself as the aforementioned ‚Äúother podcast‚Äù, but this ended up being all narrative and no story.\n\nI understand that getting your name out there is difficult, but I wish 99 PI would choose to feature 1 episode of these spin-offs and then let listeners decide to subscribe if they‚Äôd like.', 'The podcast has been slowly assuming an arrogant hipster attitude that is obnoxious. Mars talking about his precocious background is the kind of barely veiled narcissism we can do without. While Mars states all Radiotopia podcasts are the most original and creative in the universe, they each follow a template from NPR and This American Life. So, if you are a sort of semi urban poseur with a good education, yet superficial in a critical examination of the liberal arts, and mediocre grades, this is the kind of podcast that will make you feel smart, with it, and cool. Cookie cutter pseudo intellectualism you utterly predictable beautiful nerd. How about this. Would Roman Mars be as cool to you if his name was John Jones? People like you are why we have Trump and his 70 million voters. You have no idea how obnoxious you can be. T run hate you so much they will take us down with them.

However, Katie‚Äôs vocal fry and valley girl voice are so distracting that it really takes away from my enjoyment. Can‚Äôt put my finger on what exactly she is trying to do with her voice, but it‚Äôs not working!!', 'To be honest, I started listening to 99% because I had a crush on Roman. His voice just drew me in and I could not press STOP. He was just soft enough, smooth, nothing to jar the senses. I could listen to him read a grocery list. Many times I would wake up at three AM with Romans voice in my ear.  I couldn‚Äôt bear to put a sleep timer on him. The stories are enough to keep me tuned in, but add Romans voice and I am hooked. Well done. A perfect 100% for this podcast. Thank you so much', 'Katie Mingle reporting is insightful and informative.

Generally you are what I listen too when I need inspiration.', ""A few years ago as an architectural student, I began listening to 99pi to gain perspective on design. I thoroughly enjoyed the decriptions, history and explanations of various forms and concepts of design and the built environment. Unfortunately over the past year or so, Roman Mars and his staff have layered the social justice warrior cause over design, where everything bad is because of Trump, capitalism, American values, and the anthropogenic climate change, and everything good is from government intervention, social justice change, pseudo-science intellectualism, and social engineering. I'll check back occasionally to see if they've returned to their original intent of the hidden side of design, but for now, I can do without the sjw mentality.\n\nI checked back in, sorry, it's only gotten worse."", 'I can‚Äôt get enough of the mini series that are made from this podcast. Good job you guys!', 'Binging the new series According to Need and I‚Äôm compelled to write a review just to express how great it is, It‚Äôs fantastic to hear the host and the team turning such a grim subject into a great experience, her reporting is so well done. lastly the series made me think of studs Terkel for some reason.', 'Pfff. I still remember when I found this one. I was working on a big art piece and needed something to listen to. Well then I find 99 percent.

And in that podcast they can also talk about real housewives news bc if you‚Äôre not a fan of the show, you have no clue nor do you care about the housewife stories in the fast five.', 'As other reviewers have posted, Claudia and Jackie are both fully uninformed and uneducated. Most of what comes out of their mouths is ignorant and they often spread misinformation to all of their listeners. It makes me crazy! I‚Äôm not quite sure why they don‚Äôt research the fast 5 before they report on it - it‚Äôs part of your job (your 45 min job that they constantly complain about.) They take many vacations and their most recent ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù made no sense - they stated they were around someone positive, yet Claudia was in Applebee‚Äôs the day before and they waited just 1 day to take a test before going back into the studio - that‚Äôs not the way it works. It‚Äôs was clearly a lie and an excuse not to work...again.', 'I love listening to this show while folding laundry and doing things around the house. It‚Äôs light and fun and just enough gossip.

It is a romance movie and it is so sweet and heart warming and the music in the movie is literally everything of the sort! It‚Äôs not an educational movie, but it is so important that we watch normal stories starring black actors to show that black movies aren‚Äôt only worthy if they are about slavery or trying to teach us something. Highly recommend. Love y‚Äôall‚Äôs podcast so much and I have been listening for years! Have a great day!', 'I absolutely LOVE The Morning Toast.  It truly is the highlight of my day.  The reason I‚Äôm only giving a 4 out of 5 is because their episodes are unreliable.  They take A LOT of vacation.  Like, A LOT.  Which don‚Äôt get me wrong, we all deserve vacations but the amount of time they take off is frustrating (I‚Äôm probably just jealous).  Then they randomly won‚Äôt do Youtube episodes and only make it available via podcast only, and don‚Äôt tell us, so we are always trying to figure out where we can get today‚Äôs episode.  The inconsistency and lack of transparency is unprofessional and I think it‚Äôs holding them back from going to the next level.', 'Ah yes another ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù week when it‚Äôs convenient for these lazy, ignorant podcasters. Funny how they were supposedly exposed to covid last week, yet Claudia says in the next sentence she went to Applebee‚Äôs and all around the tri state area over the weekend??

Also these girls don‚Äôt know who Marilyn Manson or Evan Rachel Wood is, yet we have to hear hours of coverage on TikTok and Disney nobodies?

It‚Äôs a great way to stay informed on outdoor issues and learn hunting tactics all while having some laughs. But someone needs to check Steve. I don‚Äôt know what his deal is, but as time has gone on he‚Äôs become more challenging to listen to. \n\nI just finished episode 255, and he did a great job of proving this. At one point he literally bets someone on the show (Clay) that another cohost‚Äôs (Spencer‚Äôs) interpretation of an article they were all discussing was incorrect. He sure sounds serious about it too. Spencer goes onto read an excerpt from the article which basically shows that Steve was living in his own world and couldn‚Äôt intelligently interpret Spencer‚Äôs recounting of the article. The disrespect to call out another member of his team like that in a public forum is something else. \n\nTowards the end of the show, he interrupts Spencer again while he‚Äôs telling a story about how he (Spencer) had wished he hadn‚Äôt heard ‚Äúdon‚Äôt shoot a buck on the last day that you wouldn‚Äôt shoot on the first.‚Äù Steve just has to jump in and say that the phrase is backwards basically implying that Spencer hadn‚Äôt heard that. Everyone knows the various ways that phrase exists except for Steve apparently. Steve then continues with a rant about how you shouldn‚Äôt change weapons from bow to gun within the same hunt while simultaneously being all right with lowering standards for buck size as a hunt goes on. It‚Äôs the same thing. You couldn‚Äôt get it done with a bow, so you switched to a gun. AKA you couldn‚Äôt get a 150 so you switched to a 120. Hypocritical and totally unaware. \n\nThere were several more examples of him being generally frustrating to listen to in this episode, and it‚Äôs becoming endemic to a lot of them. He‚Äôs super intelligent and well-spoken, but I sure wish he could admit he‚Äôs wrong sometimes and stop interrupting people.', 'The buck would only be concerned about the doe‚Äôs antlers if her rack was bigger than his.', 'The shows seems to be declining in quality lately.

It is obvious that Steven Rinella is against private property ownership and the freedoms that go along with private property ownership based on the comments he and his crew have made over the course of this podcast.  It surprises me that as long as he has lived in rural and ranching communities that he still doesn‚Äôt understand those communities. These are not the only issues with the opinions of this and other affiliated podcasts, but just a couple that seem to be the most  reoccurring.  In my personal opinion, this podcast has a responsibility to put out factual and unbiased information based on how it is advertised. However,  it is apparent that there is an agenda outside the hunting community. In all fairness I listened to this podcast for over two years and came to this conclusion.  \nTake it for what it‚Äôs worth and make up your own mind.', 'Best podcast out there. Even if it seems that Janis just can‚Äôt wait for that closing remark sometimes.', 'Love the podcast, books, and show! So much of this I can relate to how I grew up and what I do now.

I can‚Äôt recommend it enough!!!', 'Why didn‚Äôt the nun Prejean once mention what the victim and her family went through?', 'Criminal is, hands down, the best true crime podcast out there.

Just like God has made each of us uniquely different and he approved each one of us! God made Pastor Joel to spread the GOOD WORD AND GOSPEL And Souls are being saved! And that‚Äôs what Jesus Christ wanted for his disciples to do! His messages are always positive and encouraging to live a positive attitude towards a Christian life and have a personal relationship with Christ! What he quotes from the Bible is correct! I actually find it quite hard to follow a sermon that is constantly being read from the Bible! I need to hear some scripture to parallel things to today‚Äôs living but I need to hear how to live in today‚Äôs society with the mind that Christ Jesus had and that God‚Äôs word is still working today like back before.

Even though I was lactose intolerant I was always Team Milkshake. They helped me to understand using pronoun etc. But the more popular they became the more lazy the research got. Especially the paranormal stuff. I was done once they started just recapping entire Ghost Adventure episodes instead of independent sourcing I could dig into a bit. At this point I skip to Christine and I‚Äôm not even that much of a true crime junkie. I was literally only listening for the paranormal stories. \n\nBetween that and the fact they cover stories larger and smaller podcasts have just covered (and more throughly without the casually sloppy pronunciations you can find all over the internet) I‚Äôm kinda done. \n\nToo much flaky banter and commercials as well.

Episodes come out on Sundays, hearing about mutilated bodies is a rough start to your week. I love Em and Christine, and their chemistry.

From loosing my dog in February, to the pandemic, to starting an internship that required me to drive 1 hour and 45 minutes each way, I never truly felt alone listening to this podcast! They are wonderful people who stand for wonderful things! If you‚Äôre a fan of paranormal, true crime and a good time, I highly recommended And That‚Äôs Why We Drink! \nAlso Eva is amazing!', 'personally, I don‚Äôt understand the reviews complaining about ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù, as if it hasn‚Äôt already permeated every bit of our lives, whether you like it or not, it‚Äôs always there and never going to go away. that being said, I whole heartedly believe that if you‚Äôre angry about politics being present in your weekly podcast, you‚Äôre a part of the problem.\n\nI‚Äôve seen a lot of listeners give feedback about the format of that show, ex: Em first, Xtine second. We all know, Em included, that they tend to interrupt and their stories tend to go longer than the latter half of the podcast. I understand that this is a time issue & I think switching up who goes first will relieve some of this. I‚Äôve noticed that the true crime portion of the podcast typically feels rushed and it‚Äôll be nice just to switch it up a bit, for the sake of balance. Podcast episodes end up being 2 hour lengths because Em‚Äôs story ends up taking up 1.5 hours of that. \n\nhonestly, overall I have found myself straying from this podcast. for years, it was my absolute favorite. I sometimes get frustrated with Em‚Äôs inability to pronounce words, when they have made a career out of podcasting. which leads me to believe that their research isn‚Äôt done extensively. I understand that they are not journalists, but with the amount of patreon subscribers & listeners, they can at least do sufficient research. and with that feedback, I think it leads to Em‚Äôs long stories. Christine is able to tell a well-researched story interestingly and concisely, in the short time that she is given. on the other hand, Em‚Äôs stories are often confusing and missing details/over-explains unimportant information, and their vocabulary is limited. overall, I just found Christine‚Äôs stories more interesting and am gravitating to more factual content, as opposed to spooky/paranormal.', 'ATWWD is hands down my favorite podcast. I love the combo of paranormal & true crime, but my favorite part of the show is Em & Christine‚Äôs banter. They‚Äôre freakin hilarious & when I listen I feel like I‚Äôm hanging out with friends.

The later episodes spend more time discussing Allied generals and allied soldier experiences, which while valuable does not have the same degree of insight. Admittedly, there is significantly more material from that perspective for English readers, the allies have taken the offensive by this point in the war, and the narrator does not neglect the Japanese perspective altogether.

Thank you, Ms. Rascoe, for your analysis of the bullying tweets and for enduring the ugliness of the former regime. Thank you, Code Switch, for sharing this analysis with us. I am not certain we would have connected the lead-up language with the insurrectionist actions as quickly. Yes, that connection has been a slow one for the media. Great observation.', 'I just wanted to thank you for the episode about how race is discussed, or rather, how it is not, in France. As an Asian-American who has lived here for over 10 years, I felt relieved that FINALLY someone was talking about the inherent racism hiding in the French language.

They humanize large, important topics with poignant interviews and in-depth research. Something new every week, but I‚Äôm guaranteed to learn and be interested. Love it!', 'I wanted to love it, I thought so many stories were really awesome and how they explain stuff. Until I heard the latest about black gun owners and I was totally disappointed and disgusted about their professionalism. Totally seems like they tricked that man into thinking they thought what he was doing was interesting just to speak on the episode and basically not only say he‚Äôs wrong but stupid.

Imagine America becoming more of a melting pot than ever, and people of color being elevated in every way possible, yet, economically and communally the country is dying. Imagine being so oppressed that your podcast is deemed podcast of the year by a company like Apple, and your media praised and pushed by every major Corporation.

I applaud your efforts in your research and your acceptance of the outcome.', 'There are never guests or interviews with people who hold views not based in some of the axioms on race held by the hosts. I think they would benefit in being challenged on some of their positions, such as the definition of racism, the reasons for disparity or inequities, and their sense of a solution.', 'Trash', 'They‚Äôre promoting a negative view of Black gun ownership. Stats regarding suicide and accidental deaths are about poor safety practices and mental health, not the act of owning a firearm itself. These increasingly out of touch positions are why Democrats are losing more and more Black and Latino support every election.', 'Y‚Äôall are the BEST - the way you all talk about race is so real and nuanced. I feel affirmed and also learn so much!', 'Great hosts covering such important topics', 'This podcast presents current and historic analysis of race so so well, leaving listeners things to conttinue learning, history to carry with us, and new perspectives to open eyes.

I respect the host‚Äôs position that just because a person is a drug addict or behaves in other dangerous ways, that does not make the story any less tragic or implies that the person in any way deserved their fate.

One little nitpicky thing I have is that occasionally the interviews can be a little bit rambling and endless feeling.

I love that it gives a voice to all aspects of the stories told about these missing persons. It remains impartial while telling the facts and knowledge. It also helps families of the lost snd missing to procede in the best way in order to find answers. This podcast gives light to these peoples lives while sharing the story to many people across the world. Getting the word out is critical because someone always knows something, they may not know that know but with these stories they might come forward with important information.

Not a hardball interviewer by any means, but he generally got out of the way and let interesting guests bring new viewpoints.\n\nThis latest run of Direct Messages has grown tiresome and repetitive. Yes, many far leftists are crazy and same folks need to push back. But The Rubin Report is starting to sound like one of those echo chambers.\n\nOnce upon a time, this might have been a podcast that someone of differing opinions could hear. Now, it‚Äôs just the same drone focused on his already-convinced audience. \n\nThe warning sign is that even though I‚Äôm a staunch classical liberal, listening to this podcast makes me want to push back against many of Dave‚Äôs tirades because they sound just as one-dimensional as the typical mainstream media garbage. \n\nHard to reconcile this new Dave with the one who toured with Jordan Peterson.', 'Best way to start my day or drive home from work.

(I‚Äôm already in the hippy world but you get what I mean) it doesn‚Äôt feel forced or cheesy.', 'I love her voice and the rhythm of her storytelling but... she inserts herself into many stories and speaks in 1st person. If it‚Äôs about her- an experience she had, who she was with- it feels like I‚Äôm outside the story, not inside it, and it doesn‚Äôt work.  It bothered me enough to unsubscribe.', 'I love this podcast and the world of Nothing Much Happens. It is a true gem. I always recommend it as well as the book to all of my friends regardless of whether they have trouble sleeping or not. The stories are charming and lighthearted and help me to remember to slow down, cherish the simple moments and focus on self-care. The ads are short and at the very beginning of the podcast so they don‚Äôt interfere with the story at all. You can also set a sleep timer by scrolling down the app so that the podcast stops playing after a certain point. The ads support Kathryn in creating more stories for all of us. This has definitely improved my sleep and I highly recommend it.', 'I like the stories but the author needs to be more attentive to her language. In the Halloween one she uses the racist term ‚ÄúPeanut Gallery‚Äù. I‚Äôd consider removing that one or re-recording. I know learning about terms such as this can take time and be frustrating as the term may have been used by your family growing up. Please take the time to remove this offensive term.', 'I‚Äôve been listening to Kathryn‚Äôs stories for a few years. Through insomnia, personal loss, and our collective challenges, and I always find her voice and stories anchor me to goodness and calm. Great for settling to sleep, they are also helpful for good start to the morning. As I doze and awaken slowly, a walk around the lake helps me open my heart to the day!', 'Nothing Much Happens was the first podcast of its kind. I searched high and low for  bedtime stories that weren‚Äôt for kids 2 years ago and came upon Kathryns podcast. From her initial set up to wind down, breathe & get cozy to her soothing voice through a story that keeps you listening while simultaneously putting you to sleep, I fell in love. I have listened every. night. for 2 years & can‚Äôt speak more highly of how much this has helped silence my anxious nighttime thoughts & get me to bed. Thank you!', 'So thrilled to have found a podcast to help me unwind at the end of my day. These stories are so enchanting and read in such a perfect, calming tone. Thank you!', 'Just lovely. Everything. The stories. Her voice. The pace. Try!', 'Super soothing but too much talk of food. Not the right time to get hungry when trying to sleep..  I would keep the stories non-food related if youre doing sleep content.', 'I‚Äôve had horrible issues with falling asleep and staying asleep for years- especially just spiraling in anxious thoughts once I lay down. I honestly don‚Äôt think any other podcast is as soothing or tells detailed stories that just RELAX you as much as in this podcast. As someone from far north, I love the winter story episodes because they make me think of childhood. I‚Äôve had no issues with the ads- a lot of podcasts have them. Been listening for months now üòå', 'This is by far my favorite podcast to help me relax and go to sleep. The stories themselves always have a cozy feel to them and the way they are read is very relaxing. I only have one complaint....I wish new episodes posted more often! Daily would be AWESOME :)', 'All these 1 star reviews are just complaining about ads - but that‚Äôs how podcasts make money!\nNo hatred for those here. I appreciate all the stories and I listen every single day. Truly my lifesaver and the perfect length to help me go to bed.', 'This podcast makes me feel so warm and gooey. I fall asleep to older ones often and get SO excited when there‚Äôs a new one to fall asleep to. The ads are no problem for me, I just start playing the podcast as I‚Äôm doing the last things in my routine so by the time I‚Äôm pulling the covers over me and cuddling up with my dogs, she is guiding the mini breath series and I am inhaling and exhaling with her. Plus her voice is soothing so, like, whatever! :) Again, LOVE this podcast. If you appreciate the small, beautiful wonders of every day life then you will, too.', ""EIDTED TO ADD: yes, there are ads. Kathryn reads the ads in her usual, soothing tone of voice at the start of the podcast. I want to bet none of the people complaining about the ads are lobbying at the congressional level for universal guaranteed income while expecting podcasters to dedicate their time and energy to producing podcasts for free. Kathryn deserves to make a living. She provides an excellent service. Ads are a legitimate way for her to do both. Don't like it? Overthrow Capitalism. \n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: No medication I have tried for insomnia helps for more than a few times. Meditation used to help, but as my anxiety ramped up, it became impossible to meditate. This podcast, this helps. I concentrate on the soothing voice telling the soothing story, and it lulls me to sleep. On the rare occasion  that I do not fall asleep, I just carry on listening to the next episode. If I am not asleep, at least I am resting instead of lying there getting anxious about not sleeping."", 'My anxious mind tends to wander most at night, even more so lately. Nothing Much Happens was recommended by one of my favorite podcast, so I decided to give it a listen. Kathryn Nicolai‚Äôs stories are cozy and her voice instantly soothes my nerves. I actually look forward to bedtime now.', 'I love this podcast. It doesn‚Äôt just help me fall asleep; it helps me relax. Even the Candy Crush ad helps me relax ... because it‚Äôs an appropriate ad and I love March-3 games. It makes me feel great. I have a few favorite episodes, and I love the details in each and how there‚Äôs enough room for me to place my own memories in the story. \n\nI love Grandmothers Grimoire, and I imagine it taking place in my grandmothers old house. And I love Cabin I the Woods and it reminds me of my baby moon along the Blue Rodge Parkway. I love going back to old episodes and listening to new ones, but I keep coming back to these. And I‚Äôve been getting amazing sleep. Thank you.', 'This podcast is one of the greatest discoveries of 2020, I love the cozy feeling it gives me before I drift off to sleep, and my son enjoys it too. We listen to it as a post bedtime story/ fall asleep story. Please keep writing and reading stories.', 'I‚Äôve always had problems quieting my mind to sleep.I listen to her voice and I can let go of my day and focus on the story.I‚Äôve been listening for months and the funny thing is I‚Äôve never made it to the end of a story without intentionally trying!Like really hard!So soothing I fall asleep every dang time.Hands down my favorite story teller.Thank you', 'This podcast has genuinely changed my life. I tend to have pretty bad sleep hygiene and insomnia. This always knocks me out no matter what. The Fireflies and Lilac Thief episodes are unparalleled, they‚Äôre soo good. Thank you for all that you do.üíñüíñ', 'I just stumbled upon this podcast and I love it!! Such a soothing voice and great stories.', 'I love this podcast, Kathryn‚Äôs soft soothing voice and her stories. I feel like I know her and can vividly imagine myself in her tales. I bought the book and can now read a story and get the same fall to sleep effect imagining her reading it to me. To all the haters, keep your ad rants to yourself. Use the fast forward to skip if you feel the need or use ad time to get cozy in your bed and prepare for the story. Sheesh. With so much happening in our world today you have to complain? Get over yourselves. Remember there‚Äôs a person, with feelings and heart, creating this content for all so BE KIND!', 'I love that the stories go with the seasons. It makes it real and easy to fall into.', 'Since I started listening to this podcast, my dreams have changed.  I used to have nearly constant stress dreams and nightmares, but these days my dreams are more imaginative spin-offs of light-filled memories, or meandering strolls in curious landscapes... sometimes I swear Kathryn is narrating them for me in her perfect voice.  Such a gift!!!']"

It feels like she often skips between thoughts without finishing it, and sometimes it seems like she‚Äôs rushing or something. I wish she would just take a breath and put down the coffee! And please interrupt less.', 'I‚Äôve been a long time listener. This podcast is built on the back of Scott who brings thoughtful insight into market dynamics and techs intersection with culture and politics. Kara‚Äôs constant interruption has become insufferable. At the end of the podcast I‚Äôm just as exhausted as Scott is. He sounds just as dejected at the end of each pod.', 'Kara and Scott teach me a lot, but oh my GOD they crack me up. Their insights do a great deal to assuage /uh-sweyzh‚Äô/ my ignorance. Please keep it up!', 'why anybody could stand to be around either one beggars belief.  Their poor families.  I don‚Äôt think either one has a feedback mechanism so they know how obnoxious they are, I guess they just can‚Äôt help themselves.', 'Interesting, fun, insightful, can‚Äôt get enough', 'I listen to lots of podcasts but this one is my favorite...love the dynamic between the two hosts, they make me laugh but keep me informed at the same time.  Keep up the great work you two.   Hi from Maine!', 'I am always so happy when new episodes drop. Scott and Kara have an unbeatable dynamic.', 'Scott is who makes this a good podcast. Despite the vast majority of analysis coming from Scott, Kara maintains a condescending, know-it-all attitude that has become increasingly unsufferable. Unsubscribing and sticking with Prof G.', 'The content is great but Kara is constantly interrupting of talking over Scott.  I hate it on television & really hate it on podcasts.', 'A good way to stay up on the latest stories, have a laugh, and get some insights on what‚Äôs going on.', 'I love the chemistry between the two hosts and the hot takes they have. I feel as though they balance each other‚Äôs opinions well and have great discussions every podcast! The podcast never fails to boost my mood! Highly recommend !!', 'Love the show, just one suggestion.\nPlease Kara can you let Scott talk sometimes, you cut him off or interrupt him constantly, not great to your co- host .', 'I mostly enjoy this podcast. Scott is particularly well spoken and really explains himself well. Sometimes I have a problem with Kara not articulating well or completing her thoughts.  It can also be a bit repetitive.', 'Been a fan of these 2 for a long time and I just can‚Äôt quit them. Swisher is a strong (if occasionally narcissistic) interviewer and Galloway has a lot of edutainment rants that inevitably veer into his own set of tropes and cliches but are still loaded with insight. \nTo Galloway, every issue triggers a ‚Äòvast transfer of wealth‚Äô spiel and to Swisher, every issue is one where rich and very powerful women like herself like her are being horribly oppressed. It‚Äôs so tiresome yet every once in a while they have the best interviews you‚Äôll find anywhere and it‚Äôs worth listening for those moments.', 'Pivot is my current favorite podcast. While other podcast episodes queue up in my feed, I listen to the latest episode of pivot as soon as it drops. Kara and Scott‚Äôs blistering take on tech, business, and politics is usually spot on and doesn‚Äôt pull punches. Kara‚Äôs focus razor-like commentary nicely balances Scott‚Äôs rambling rants (which are always insightful and sometimes hilarious). They are unapologetic about calling the powerful to account, especially big tech firms that abuse their power. One criticism how they frequently drop the names of influential figures that they know and have interviewed. I can‚Äôt tell if they are trying to impress themselves, each other, or the audience. Other than that, I am on board with the Sheriff of the Internet and the Dawg.', 'If you do not save Galloway from overexposure he is going to bring down the podcast with him. And that would make me sad. Back to mid level obscurity for him or else.', 'They‚Äôre scum. 4/5 stars.', 'I understand that Scott rails against billionaires and says that the minimum wage is too low but then castigates people who actually do something about it with their stimulus checks and Robinhood accounts. \nNo idea who his co-host is though. \nHey Scott, have you said that people spent too much time on their phones and not enough time in the gym or developing relationships BEFORE they started the GME shenanigans? Nope. I‚Äôm betting you didn‚Äôt. You were fine with atomization until they started making money at the expense of certain people.', 'Great podcast...but frustrating often times when Kara interrupts Scott at some of his most salient moments.  Otherwise I‚Äôd have given 5 stars. But again, FANTASTIC SHOW.', 'No no no, Scott, when you‚Äôre in the wrong, you say ‚ÄúSorry, I was wrong, I‚Äôll do better‚Äù. That‚Äôs literally all you have to do. Don‚Äôt try to dig yourself out, don‚Äôt interrupt Kara or Rebecca with continuous excuses. You‚Äôre just wrong,  ü§´ üòå.', 'Love P√≠vot so much, such a great news resource. But has anyone else noticed that Scott‚Äôs voice sounds sped up?! It‚Äôs distracting!', 'His Prof G podcast has all his brilliant insights without Kara‚Äôs condescending attitude and incessant political messaging. Scott should just focus on his own podcast.', 'Are they not insurrectionists? What about our Vice President? She raised money to bail out the BLM people who got arrested. Why could people argue that the 2016 election was stolen but not the 2020? You are also racists! Cruz and Rubio are Hispanics but because they‚Äôre males and conservatives , it‚Äôs ok to bash them?', '...is very disappointing', ""You two crack me up.  Never thought I'd enjoy and learn about financial things so much.  Thank you!  And BTW Kara, I live in Vero Beach and feel your pain!"", 'It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve had technical problems like this. The show downloads so slowly (around 75 KB/s), that I have trouble completing the download and playing it. Seriously thinking about unsubscribing.\n\nI don‚Äôt have this problem with other podcasts.', 'Creepy how these 2 endorse Fox. So you‚Äôre okay with the white supremacy propaganda outlet. Old rich white washed up. Swisher seems to be a fan of Stephanie Rheule. I listened 3 times, she was mentioned twice. Ew. Talk about a crazy little Trumpmonkey. May I recommend Throughline?', 'The chemistry combined with insights, observations and opinions are magic.  Definitely one of my favorite listens.', 'Have loved your show for a long time but you‚Äôve been lured by the politics monster. 70% of your content is politics now. Don‚Äôt mind a little bit IG this on the side but can you please get back to making a show primarily about your interesting business takes? I can go to The Daily for liberal political insights, I can‚Äôt get your style of business insights anywhere else. Thank you (said in Kara Swisher voice)', 'Kara and Scott make me a smarter with every episode. Great chemistry, snark, wit, and deep dives into how tech is affecting our lives.', 'From the snowden insults, to kara repeatedly cutting off Scott and wanting to jump from topic to topic instead of digging into the discussion, to one sided political conversations instead of business analysis the episode was off and the show in general has been sliding. Hope they turn it around‚Äîwould love for kara to up the energy and be happy to discuss instead of dismissing ideas and moving on.', 'Show is litterally all politics. They go to a business topic only to go back to politics üò¥', 'He‚Äôs always great. I hate how Kara keeps interrupting Scott and her guests. You can tell Prof losing his mojo at the end of the show.', 'These guys are way smarter than you. If you don‚Äôt believe me just ask them. They will tell you. They have no problem telling Americans to sit at home without a paycheck so they can feel safer. However it‚Äôs easy because these guys continue to draw a paycheck. And no mention of sharing that paycheck with the folks they insist go without a paycheck. Entitled, bigoted podcast would be more on point. As long as you understand that the hosts are better than you, all will be well. Nothing but conspiracy theories.', 'You know your show is getting boring and running out of ideas when a nominally ‚Äútech and business‚Äù podcast is just the same old same old political discussion every single episode.']"

I have listened to nearly every episode of this show. \n\nThose being sensitive over the pronouns are likely going to be unsuccessful with practical investments.

Read Andrews book, sign up for his e letter and buy the spreadsheet and you‚Äôll feel a lot more confident about investing. People who listen to one episode and leave a negative review did not give them a chance. They do not want to learn just be told what to do. I have learned an insane amount in just a month or two.

I opened my first stock account today having absolutely no idea what I was doing. I still have absolutely no idea what I‚Äôm doing. Decided to listen to some podcasts before I started trading, or rather buying because I have nothing to trade right now, and the first episode of this podcast the guy asked how to monitor his stocks. The information that I was looking for as a beginner, starts well before that, like how to decide what stocks to even buy. I‚Äôll come back to this podcast when I get a bit more experience, I guess.', 'Like stop staying Like so much Like you know', 'This is a very poor podcast, both in form and content. There is so much better out there, these guys are amateurs.', 'I‚Äôve been impressed with this podcast. These guys really explain things in an easy way. I‚Äôve found that going back and listening to older episodes after a little time has passed makes them easier to understand too.', 'As a person with little-to-no experience in the stock market, I really enjoy listening to this podcast. I do admit that the first couple of episodes were a little overwhelming with terminology that I‚Äôm unfamiliar with, but after taking notes and writing down common words to learn their definition, I can understand the conversations much better. The concepts are also repeated throughout the episodes which helps drive the point home! I can engage in conversation about stocks confidently with only being 11 episodes in as I write this (even with working while listening!).

I will admit, I was a little skeptical of him from the way Teen Mom 2 portrays him; but after hearing his side of the story I have grown to adore him.

I don‚Äôt mean to be critical, I‚Äôm simply letting you know as I‚Äôm sure I can‚Äôt be the only one who feels this way. \n\nI love hearing your stories and your antics, especially about the boys. Yours is also the only podcast I listen to where I actually enjoy the ads, I love how you personalize them. \n\nYou‚Äôre both an inspiration to so many people. Keep working hard and thank you for sharing your lives with us!', 'I love listening to Kail and Lindsieüíõ my daughter and I would listen to you guys every Thursday on our way to work we were fortunate enough to commute together. Definitely our fave!!', 'OMG.   This past weeks episode on Will and Goodwill is beyond amazing!!!  Yes we need more deets on this!!!!', 'I was listening to last pod cast where Kail mentions how her dog destroys all beds. Check out k9 ballistics dog beds.  They are pricey but well worth it. My dog is a digger and these are the only beds she doesn‚Äôt destroy. Try them they are worth it!  \nI love the dynamic between Kail and Lindsay, you guys make me laugh all the time!! Keep it up! Much love‚ô•Ô∏è', 'Love that you guys are very neutral and allow people to have an opinion. You‚Äôre a great team.', 'I just finished the one where they discuss Britney Spears and I was so frustrated while listening I came here. I‚Äôve been listening to this podcast for awhile. Kail is a GREAT podcaster. She‚Äôs relatable, good at conversation, and her laugh is adorable. I wish I had something nice to say about Lindsie. She talks soooooo slow. She thinks she has a ‚Äúhot take‚Äù on every single topic when most of the time her opinion is just what the majority of us are thinking. Her privileged life is very obvious. This women truly just doesn‚Äôt have a clue. Thankful kail & vee have their podcast where I can enjoy BOTH podcasters!', 'Prince William Arthur Philip Lewis Windsor', 'i‚Äôve been a long time of kail, we‚Äôre the same age and i‚Äôve followed her since her 16 and pregnant days and I absolutely love getting to know her further and more authentically through this podcast! with that said, I didn‚Äôt know much about miss lindsey! she is so funny and relatable, I love her stories about her husband üòÇ and we share a love of true crime and other interests! I recommend this podcast all the time, thanks for always putting your all into every episode, love you guys! üòÅ', 'Lindsie speaks 1 word every 10 seconds. It makes it very difficult to listen to. Skip through Brittany Spears episode because it sounds like Lindsie is drugged. She cannot put together a sentence. I don‚Äôt know how Kail doesn‚Äôt scream at her. I had to turn it off. Lindsie is half of this podcast but she‚Äôs the half bringing it down.', 'My boyfriend is a Goodwill ‚Äúseeker‚Äù.\n\nHe does find some clothes for work like flannels and stuff. \n\nBut he is always on the hunt for art work! He will spend hours on eBay looking up the prints and researching them. He has picked up a few he says that are with some money. But he hasn‚Äôt sold one yet lol. But he enjoys it and I get it. I could spend hours in a hobby lobby or filling a cart of some sort online lol.', 'I love this podcast so much. I grab my Starbucks and drive around listening to my favorite girls, that is my ME time! These girls have both been through a lot and they still come out on top! Keep it up ladies! You‚Äôre rockstars!', 'I have been inlove with this podcast since it came out! These two ladies are the best and i absolutley love listening to them weekly. Always make the start of my Thursday much better, and cant wait till the next weeks to hear the shenanigans. They are so relateable that i feel as if we would be bestest friends, need a third host? LOL \n\nLove you ladies', 'A few weeks behind in listening, but I just LOVED the ep with Jamie Otis! I have followed her since she was on The Bachelor and just love her. Great episode, as always!!', 'I just recently started listening to coffee convos in December. Let me just say I absolutely love it. I have followed Kail since 16 and pregnant and have watched Lindsie since the beginning of Chrisley Knows Best. I listen to you all day at work and it makes my day pass by so fast. Sometimes I‚Äôll be laughing uncontrollably and my coworkers will look at me like what is going on. I just want to say I look forward to listening every day. I have taken so much motherly advice and applied it to my life. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing and shining regardless of all the haters/trolls.', 'You ladies are the bomb.com!!!', 'I love you two so much I wish you guys could do longer episodes or maybe even two a week.', 'Everyone is complaining about Lindsey having ‚Äúrich people problems‚Äù but it‚Äôs relatable... af. Keep on keeping on ladies, I think you both are hilarious.', 'I was so appalled to listen to Lindsie complain about the people painting her house because they stopped because it was going to rain!  Are you kidding?  I think house painting is more than a day job or perhaps you might just do it yourself and see how fast you can accomplish this. And, they should remove all the tape and coverings when they leave and the job is not yet completed. Would you expect them to re-apply all of this each time they continue the project? I have never painted the outside of a home, but know from painting rooms that the prep time is major. I really could not believe how out of touch you are. I really enjoy the show, but you, Lindsie, complain a lot.']"

The length of episodes and the personalities of the hosts make it very digestible and enjoyable.', 'This show has gotten much better since I started listening!

I love the chemistry between Stacy and Cardiff and how they break down complicated economic topics into fun, simple, memorable nuggets.', 'I typically don‚Äôt like listening to NPR because they always manage to say sexist, racist, or outright false things on their more political oriented shows. Sadly this show is no exception. The hosts perpetuate unsubstantiated, and ultimately, racist claims that COVID-19 originated form China when new data points to earlier cases in Italy. When everyone on the show is white or belongs to the elite class, all I hear is subtlety veiled disdain for the perspectives of people who have to live through the worst parts of this country.', 'Lol!

Some science, some tongue in cheek, some fascinating entertainment.', 'Thanks for the great podcast.', 'I‚Äôm a big fan of the show and have learned a lot but because of Stacey Vanek Smith‚Äôs annoying, unnecessary laugh, dumb questions and bizarre jokes I stopped listening for one year.

I‚Äôve started downloading the show again though despite SVM.', 'I started listening because it was a different kind of podcast.I listen to a lot of politics in so this was very refreshing and I‚Äôm learning a lot. The podcast are not boring And they keep the subjects interesting. I‚Äôm learning about things that I never thought much about in the past. Thank you I highly recommend it.', 'Love the show!! Stacy and Cardiff, plus Patty and other guest hosts and contributors are knowledgeable, well spoken and interesting. Great short snippets that help me remember the importance of Econ class and provide great examples for those not steeped in the material to better understand the world around us. Keep up the great work! There‚Äôs lots of demand for the the stories you supply üòâ', 'Thanks to The Indicator, I made changes in my car payment and credit card.

I would prefer episodes with more comprehensive coverage of the subject in question, but that‚Äôs just not what this show is designed to give. If you want a deep dive into these subjects then other options will be preferable. However, for quick episodes that give a glimpse into an important aspect of a story, this show does a great job.', 'More Donald trump i need to be updated', 'A+', 'Platforming a Manhattan Institute economist to talk about Covid risk isn‚Äôt a good look. In fact it‚Äôs quite bad.', 'Great podcast on economics! But the latest episode on ‚Äú\nEvaluating the Washington Consensus‚Äú left me wonder if you have looked into the study to make sure that the conclusion they reached had considered the possibility of mere correlation? \nWhat about similar countries that didn‚Äôt particularly heed to the Washington Consensus?

Not enough real content. \nNeed to do you homework. \nFor instance, when it comes to trade with a foreign country, if it‚Äôs a national risk, it is also against the rules to trade components with other countries that trade with company A. \nThis avoid loopholes for the sake of money.', 'I‚Äôve been listening to this podcast since it started and generally enjoy the content. Informative, timely, and doesn‚Äôt take all day to listen to an episode. They do a pretty good job of staying objective politically, however, as a production of NPR, one has to expect some bias toward the left on occasion. For example, they just did two episodes on the economic policies of Joe Biden versus Donald Trump. Guess whose policies were presented in a straightforward, fair manner, and whose were characterized as unrealistic and based on ‚Äúrhetoric‚Äù? But putting that aside, I do enjoy this podcast and will continue to listen In spite of the left-leaning point of view. God gave us brains so we can take it all in and make up our own minds!', 'There is very little new information provided by this podcast. And the hosts are annoying.', 'Maybe post less frequently  but improve on the interest factor.', 'Very informative and objective.', 'Ever since COVID this podcast has been more political. I thought the opinions on the topic used to be fair and based on facts. Now I just can‚Äôt listen to it anymore. I‚Äôm really disappointed.', 'Like so much at NPR , the program has slipped letting personal rage over Trump impact content and analysis', 'Amazing, just like Planet money. I listen every week.. and really enjoy it. Very informative and entertaining. I am constantly awed by how they find superbly interesting topics, and manage to make a very lucid and engaging show about it. \n\nThis show is one of the reasons I donate to NPR. Thank you NPR, for putting this together.', 'This is an interesting podcast, but it asks GREAT questions that never get answered. I‚Äôd love it if there was a little more depth to the research. It would probably have to be a little longer, and they may not release as many episodes, but that would be fine with me because these are great topics I‚Äôd love to know more about!

Not on every policy but in the same spirit of believing in her honest intentions at reaching many of the same end goals.

While I disagree with her on many aspects of policy, she is a woman of high character and integrity - something that is sorely lacking in this world. \n\nIf she were President, I would trust her 100% to make decisions based on her moral compass and integrity rather than pandering to liberals, conservatives, or special interest groups. This is the reason she was ignored by the DNC. \n\nI‚Äôm looking forward to this podcast and some intelligent, nuanced, and honest conversations about life, politics, and surfing.', 'We need more Tulsi and Less Divisiveness!

I feel she has been trying very hard since hosting this podcast to deliver her feeling/opinion/idea to audience, but either her feeling is actually not authentic enough or did not make me feel what she felt and also her way of interacting with guests is somehow boring, she need to learn how to ask intriguing questions or questions audience actually care about.\n\nI understand new host need time to adjust, that is why I tried listen to the latest episode once while to check if the quality of the show has improved, but after more than 6 months, I don‚Äôt think that is going to happen.

Also, the Elizabeth Smart interview made me cringe. It was Tone deaf on his part. I literally felt bad for her and like he was victimizing her all over.

Once or twice my critical thinking alarm bells gave a chirp, but it wasn\'t immediately concerning so I kept listening on occasion. However, after listening to as muchas I could make it through 1054 Joe Dispenza, I can\'t trust the content and I can\'t keep listening. \n\nFirst point of order, Dispenza is not a doctor, does not hold a PhD or an MD, and should not be referred to with the title Dr. The fact that he is referred to as such, as a lover of science, really undermines the validity of the show. \n\nSecondly, in this episode Dispenza can hardly manage to answer a good proportion of Lewis Howes\' fairly simple questions. This may not make sense at first, but after 40 minutes I started to catch on that this podcast was very little like an interview or a dialogue like others I had heard. There was no structure being provided by Lewis. It was as if I had just turned on a lecture by Dispenza rather than an interview with him. \n\nYes, Dispenza is a New Age spiritual healer type, and sells a ton of healing and meditating lessons and courses on his website, as fits the bill for a new age healer. The fact that he got nearly complete reign of this episode in my opinion means he simply got another avenue by which to collect more spiritual customers. Some of the things he said actually resonated with me - but as a scientifically minded critical thinker I absolutely cannot ignore that he gave no support for his findings (besides his own research studies). \n\nHe threw out terms like ""quantum"", ""gamma"", talked about ""heart frequencies"" for a long time, without defining even one of them, and Lewis didn\'t ask for a definition of any of these either. Perhaps these concepts make sense to people deep in new age lore, but for the average normie, not at all. To not define them to a new audience reeks of cultism - a ""fake it til you make it"" kind of knowledge where everyone relies on the teacher and the more advanced students, thinking ""Surely someone understands this language"" but in truth, no one does, because it\'s all fake and not scientifically founded. \n\nAs for the fact that Lewis successfully recorded and published this episode, I honestly can\'t forgive. If he\'s on a journey to become great, I would have imagined that he had honed his critical thinking skills to be able to tell the difference between the many worldviews that come your way when you search for truth. Someone who can\'t do the simple pleasure of defining unfamiliar terms is not leading you to truth and understanding, but to fake news and incoherence. \n\nPerhaps Lewis didn\'t pick up on the New Age garbage being spouted, in which case, I simply can\'t trust this podcast to teach me anything about greatness, not anything that\'s real and valid anyway. Or perhaps there was some other reason he and his team decided to record and publish this episode - maybe they had a schedule to meet, maybe ratings are down, maybe he has a great longstanding relationship with Dispenza. In that case, Lewis and team decided to put their short term needs - a schedule, a rating, a relationship - over the eternal human search for greatness. \n\nIf you\'re going to have a podcast with a lofty name, it should hold fast to lofty ideals as well. There are podcasts with much more humble names and initial concepts that do a superior job of performing with consistent moral standards.', 'Was this one podcast #1069? I learned so much out of this podcast. \n\nI was hoping that the length of it would not seem so long, was it going to be worth it to listen to the whole thing because I already listen to Grant and company on the regular. \n\nBest podcast I have heard in years, perhaps ever! I‚Äôve been watching Undercover Billionaire, the behind-the-scenes details were bigger lessons than the episodes. Whoever edits this season‚Äôs episodes makes it seem completely different and disappointing compared to reality ... all the important material left out.\n\nGrant was honest, real, humble, helpful, and I felt that I gained, personally and professionally. I plan to listen again soon. Mr. Howes asked him pointed questions phrases in an unflattering light at times, yet, Grant owned each well, I thought.\n\nThen Mr. Howes encouraged him and I loved their interaction and mutual respect. This is what we need more of in the world. Being real, wanting to inspire and motivate, sharing insights, sharing what it takes to win! \n\nWe need this more than ever, now! I learned! I needed it! \n\nSo, thank you! I‚Äôd love to follow along every year as success mounts exponentially!!!', 'A friend of mine introduced me to this podcast in early 2019 and I was immediately floored by it. I remember feeling like Lewis wasn‚Äôt speaking to the masses - no, I was sure he must be speaking directly to me. The relevancy of his content was exactly what I needed in a difficult time. This podcast inspired me to ask for help and motivated me to start making changes in my life. \n\nFrom there, I started subscribing to similar podcasts. All with their own unique approach, centered around building a better ‚Äúyou.‚Äù As a perfectionist this became a problem. The volume of advice was overwhelming and increasingly impossible to navigate. I‚Äôve taken a step back and learned it‚Äôs far more about progress and far less about perfection. There is no one answer or solution to finding your perfect life. But, there are a lot of small steps that progress our life journey in a positive way. This is a fantastic place to start.', 'Lots of great substance in these interviews', 'Lewis has had some interesting guests but regardless of his guest, it is always impossible to get through an episode. Lewis is simply not a good podcast host. He does not listen well even though it is clear he thinks he does. He projects often and he constantly interrupts to talk about himself. Nothing worse than an interviewer who asks a question and does not listen to the answer genuinely before interrupting and bringing it back to the same story listeners have heard over and over about his life. It and he feel very inauthentic. GREAT pass on this one!! So many other podcasts well worth your time.', 'I love this podcast! Lewis is a great interviewer and listener! You can feel him listening like us... the audience! Episode 1054 was one of the BEST episodes I‚Äôve ever listened to! So happy this information is out there. Thank you thank you!!', 'Well done and helpful with the details of the vaccine pros and cons. I learned more details and it strengthened my decision to get a vaccine. Get the facts not some odd ball theory. I recommend this podcast.', 'Thanks for having podcasts that are not futile but of substance.  You let the guest speak and your interactions are also meaningful almost like a great genius game which light years beyond so many others full of chatter, hollowness or self deprecation.  I am a fan tic of sound so kudos on sound quality!', 'I‚Äôve listened to this religiously in the past but have been so turned off recently. Honestly Lewis, I think that your viewpoint on Covid-19 and the vaccine is boosted by your privilege in the world. Of course to you, this disease isn‚Äôt as big in your life because you don‚Äôt live in a low-income community, nor are you someone who is more susceptible to having severe symptoms if you were to contract covid. I think you should make that a point in these conversations and not generalize or belittle the impact of this disease. I‚Äôm very disappointed in your lack of empathy.', 'Lewis has used his past and his story and turned it into something so great and he can find and interview guests with that same greatness. The conversations he has with his amazing guests are inspiring, informative, and real. I listen to almost all his podcast episodes, trust me you will not regret it!', 'Lewis‚Äô podcasts never disappoint.

I love his energy, message and curiosity. He is authentic and passionate about helping others live their fullest lives. \n\nHis guests and podcasts will challenge you, inspire you and fill you with tools and enthusiasm!', 'Lewis Howes is an ok interviewer. His guest is what has me coming back again and again. The episodes are very hit and miss for me. If the guest or subject is uninteresting I will just skip the episode because the ads are so annoying. There is a lot of ‚Äúfive minute fridays‚Äù that are mostly a waste of time and just a way for Lewis to plug another product or service . Just skip those episodes, trust me. All in all not a bad show depending on the episode. \nPs \nThe David goggins episode 715 is a very good episode.', 'I love the content he presents. I also love the guests he brings on. I enjoyed Candace Parker to Katrin Davisdottir. I feel I get into the flow of the conversation then I hear his annoying ads in the middle of it. I would much prefer if he did the ads in the beginning or the end of an episode. It‚Äôs a shame because I definitely like the content.', 'Love listening to this podcast. It‚Äôs always informational and I always learn something. Feels good to expand mind power and enjoy it at the same time! I love that there are guests from many different disciplines also‚Äîmakes for more interesting conversation. Thanks Lewis for providing such a rad podcast!', 'One of the most encouraging podcast that actually gives you real life tactics and ways to achieve instead of just a series of motivational quotes.', 'I love listening to this podcast! It‚Äôs one of my favorites. But I really wish that political discussions were left out. The world is a tough place right now, and I don‚Äôt come to this podcast for those matters to be discussed. Everyone is TIRED of hearing about politics so why must you bring it up in your interviews? I‚Äôve only heard it discussed in one or two so far, but it really rubs me the wrong way when it is discussed. It ruins my mood. I absolutely love this podcast but when politics are brought up I automatically stop listening.', 'I legit can‚Äôt get enough of this podcast. I love Lewis Howes‚Äôs disarming and enthusiastic style and his guests across all disciplines offer holistic and transformative wisdom because they‚Äôve lived it. You can feel that Lewis and his guests really want to give back and serve the community.', 'I absolutely love all of your shows! Just listened to episode 1055 and wow! Mind blown! It would be incredible if you had Dr. Joe back on you show to talk about creating wealth! Thanks for always sharing all of the wisdom and information from you and your speakers.', 'I just love to listen to it both actively and passively when I‚Äôm going about with my daily activities. I always pick up new stuff on the go.', 'This guy just rambled on and on. I am aware of reports that positive thinking has helped people heal but this guy is really out there. If he thinks that positive thoughts will save you from Covid he is sadly mistaken.', 'Lewis Howes has the most diverse selection of guests on his show, all with the intention of providing positive outlooks and helpful positive information about life for his listeners. He asks great questions and really pulls out the greatness of each guest he interviews. Each episode is a gem. I highly recommend this podcast to everyone I know and am an avid fan . - Shay S.', 'Thank you for sharing wisdom and positivity in this world, love listening to your mindset and motivational content!!!!', 'This podcast has been such a tool in my growth & journey throughout everything. I can‚Äôt get enough! Lewis hits every topic. My go to when I‚Äôm having brain fog or self doubt!', 'Lewis is a supreme interviewer and knows how to motivate, teach and learn all at the same time. Found this show a few months back and have listened to it religiously ever since. Couldn‚Äôt recommend it more.', 'This has been one of my favorites for the last couple of years and has driven a lot of positive changes I‚Äôve made in my life. I enjoy listening in the morning and getting some new perspectives to recall throughout the day from the fascinating people Lewis interviews. Grateful for this content!', 'More white male privilege here... no thanks', 'I love listening to everyone‚Äôs definition of greatness at the end of each podcast.

The ideas are there, but the way the content is executed is not all there. I‚Äôm not sure that this should have been a ‚ÄúHOW-TO‚Äù show as it may have been something else like a documentary series with a prescription at the end.

It completely glossed over the numerous cases when buying makes no financial sense. Nor did they touch on the opportunity cost of buying. With renting, if you consistently invest the money you‚Äôre not spending on HOA fees, taxes, interest, and maintenance, you are often better off doing so in many markets (like NYC) rather than buying.', 'I have learned SO much from this show!

I highly recommend for anyone just trying to figure out life!', 'So I LOVE the idea of this podcast, a lot of the topics are current and have potential to be useful.  It‚Äôs the execution.\n\nThe direction it takes on sensitive subjects comes from a position of perfect world or looking from the outside in. It‚Äôs missing the other persons POV and is out of touch if you aren‚Äôt 20-30 years old dealing with a 40-50 year old on the other side.  After listening to a few sensitive subject topics, I stopped as all I would do is get mad from it and wasn‚Äôt productive.  So I only listen to the lighter ones going forward.', 'If you want to learn how to do things that matter, look no further!', 'This podcast series covers all sorts of topics and provides great information.  Definitely a great one to check out!', 'The life kit podcast displays extreme bias, yet covers interesting topics. Most of the advice given is not practical- such as the advice to make better coffee being to ‚Äútake daily notes on your coffee making process‚Äù as if anyone would dedicate a notebook and title it ‚Äòdaily coffee log, experience and emotions‚Äô. The bias is extremely left wing, without considering their responsibility to present all facts if they are going to be offering holistic advice or wisdom. An example of their extremist bias is the birth control episode- where they won‚Äôt use the term ‚Äúwoman‚Äù at all while describing  women‚Äôs birth control- instead saying ‚Äúuterus‚Äù. While I appreciate and value their attempts at inclusivity, it seems to be diluting and confusing their content (although I admit I am not a gender expert).  In the same birth control episode, they were also intent on breaking down birth control marketing, seeing as it oftentimes depicts heterosexual women. From a business and common sense perspective, it makes complete sense that the advertising would be geared towards heterosexual women, seeing as that is their target market segment. In general, the undertone of this podcast seems to be slightly angry, as if there is some moral duty to point out every flaw, while not exploring every explanation nor alternative. Overall, I think the core of this podcast is great, who doesn‚Äôt need advice? However, I don‚Äôt think this is advice-grade content and I would love to see them take a more holistic approach, display less bias and keep up with the great topics!', 'Most of the camping episode was about how to make camping more woke.

Until Barry Hardiman pivoted after Julia‚Äôs comment, she was negging hard on aging. She even stressed that her passion for sunscreen is based on blocking UVA rays which are responsible for visible signs of aging, rather than melanoma and other actually deadly consequences of sun exposure. I was really sad to hear how easily this rolled off Barry‚Äôs tongue, no reservations, no shame. The stigma against aging is rampant, it‚Äôs culturally accepted, it‚Äôs caustic, and it needs to stop. Thank you again Julia : )', 'I just started listening to this podcast today and have already listened to about six episodes. I love how approachable the advise is.

It‚Äôs silly to be hesitant about a podcast - you either listen and stay tuned or you don‚Äôt and move on elsewhere.  But I was hesitant.  I think because, at first glance, the content covered in these episodes struck me as addressing all the areas in life that for the most part, I had very little interest  in having repeated back to me. So initially I listened, but it was listening with a healthy  side of suspicion.  And I‚Äôm glad I did.  Listen that is, cause this podcast is actually the opposite of what I feared it may be.  Instead, each episode could be described as a reassuring and insightful pep talk moderated by hosts (Sam!) you‚Äôd trust to seek advice from.  I just finished the episode on grief in the time of covid (I lost a family member a week ago) and a wave of emotion came over me, it brought up a lot of feelings I couldn‚Äôt quite put a finger on until now.  Sam is brilliant, if there was a word that encompassed being both intellectual and having no trace of pretension, just being purely curious and authentic- that word would describe  sam.  And Sure, there are episodes where the topic being covered is perhaps more complex or nuanced than a podcast -any podcast -could fully thresh out, but that‚Äôs why this show is so great - there‚Äôs no insistence that any approach suggested is the only or only correct one.   And really, that‚Äôs often all it takes to get motivated and have the confidence that you can take on challenges you face.  Subscribe.  It‚Äôs worth it.', 'I enjoy listening to these podcasts, but I noticed some  recycling of podcasts.

My heart breaks reading the negative reviews that manage to\nmiss the whole point, even when the podcast title broadcasts its thesis loud and clear. Yes, families should be able to look after their own, but this is a systemic tradition of falling ‚Äúthrough the cracks‚Äù that spans generations, and it is a tradition that renders its victims unable to care for loved ones.', 'Through the cracks tells of a very sad tragedy in a well written, well produced tone. Inequity is threaded throughout the story building up to very little responsibility being placed on the parents. Leaving behind a trail of unpaid housing that lead to 5 evictions, living in a hotel for a year with no expenses and then offered a free place to stay at a temporary shelter looks like advantages offered to the family again and again. Somewhere the cycle should break with education on being a responsible, contributing member to society. All of the avenues put in place to help were set up as temporary assistance, never meant to sustain families long term. Shelters in metropolitan areas have always been deemed a short term solution. I wish the podcast would have also included the serious questions of; If the parents were both non-disabled and willing to get jobs that could sustain their families why after so many years of having no bills to pay weren‚Äôt they able to save enough money to move out of the shelter. Why didn‚Äôt they apply through the system for housing allowances? Was this family on other avenues of help, free health care, free food, free housing? And also when five evictions happened, the podcast makes it seem as if the landlords were at fault. They also have bills that need to be paid whether their renters pay on time or not. The story line feels skewed and desperate to make the listener feel sorry for the choices that Relisha‚Äôs parents made. The biggest truth is that Relisha was failed from the start and children should never fall through the cracks.', 'As a DC local I went into this podcast thinking I knew all about it.  I mean, it was all over the news when it happened and often pops up as reports try to bring new attention to the case.  In listening to this, I realize that what I didn‚Äôt know was the people, the utterly broken system, and the reality that this could happen again.  The host does a great job bringing this story to life and exposing the system that allowed it to happen.  A great (although heartbreaking) listen for anyone regardless of how much background information you have on Relisha‚Äôs disappearance.', 'Very informative. Thank you for telling her story!!', 'Insightful. Heartbreaking. And a thorough and VERY well told true story.', 'This podcast just might be my new ‚ÄúSerial‚Äù. I keep going back to it and starting from the beginning. Generational trauma is real! It‚Äôs hard to reconcile with the fact that Relisha‚Äôs kidnapping could have been prevented. This is a tragic story.', 'A tragic and important tale. This story highlights so many relevant topics that need to be discussed more. An excellently produced telling of a difficult and complex story. It is told with care and compassion, and really makes you think. I‚Äôm thankful for the creators bringing this story to the forefront. I heard about this podcast from a recommendation given on my favorite murder. I can‚Äôt wait for the next episode, and hopefully more seasons of this great podcast.', 'How did this mother not report her child missing after 18 minutes or hours, let alone days.\nMy heart breaks for this child and her family but to suggest that it was the government‚Äôs responsibility to keep tabs on her is ludicrous.\nThey say in this podcast that the rules of the shelter are that parents are to be with their children at all times and the mother parentified her daughter and then trusted her care to the wrong person.\nTragic - but the blame is not on the school.', 'This is an important podcast for a myriad of reasons. We must never forget Relisha and must continue to fight to protect all the Black girls in our lives.', 'Anyone who wants to judge Relisha‚Äôs family does not know the shameful history of this country. Black people have been denied basic rights, fairness, education and opportunity.', 'Excellent storytelling and production. This is a tragic case that highlights racial, economic, and social inequalities in the DC area, but these inequalities can really be applied to any city in America. I knew of Relisha Rudd before listening to ‚ÄúThrough the Cracks‚Äù but I hope that this podcast brings her and her family‚Äôs story to others‚Äô attention.', 'While the story is heart breaking- let‚Äôs all be very clear. The biggest person who failed Raleshia isn‚Äôt the school, DC General, or a few landlords. It is the family who had a legal responsibility to care for her. \nThe host is hookah out of her way to the adults in her family with kid gloves. It‚Äôs bizarre. I know the podcast was doomed episode one when the host thought it was ‚Äòadorable‚Äô when Raleshia met a man on the bus and on the spot asked him to come to her house & be her dad. Host said that Raleshia was acting as a ‚Äòmatchmaker‚Äô. This is signs of extreme abuse and trauma! Not cute. \n\nWhat happened to this child is absolutely tragic. And it‚Äôs be a good idea to start drawing the rings of responsibility a bit closer to center.', 'I‚Äôm a native Washingtonian and this story about Relisha was front and center of multiple news stories between 2014 & 2015 then all of sudden it disappeared. I‚Äôm happy to hear more details and more reporting on the real story and what possibly happened. My hope is that this will continue past the first season and maybe she‚Äôll continue to investigate other stories of black disappearances that are rarely if ever shared!!! Great job and keep it up!!!', 'This podcast masterfully weaves together the complicated threads of nuance, accountability and sympathy. The story is heartbreaking but the host does a great job of holding your hand while walking you through it.', 'I am learning so much not only about my city, but the the honesty of parenting, privilege and story telling. This is so well done.', 'It‚Äôs unfortunate that people feel the government or organizations are responsible for parenting their children.  The concept of personal responsibility and accountability is completely absent from this podcast. Don‚Äôt waste your time listening. It‚Äôs a terribly sad story, but it examines all the wrong aspects of the case.', 'I enjoy the storytelling and story line. However, despite the failings I see in the shelter system and school for not better protecting and keeping track of this young girl, the truth is it is the parents fault. There is no excuse to not know where your child is for 18 days. Clearly the family is dysfunctional and it‚Äôs sad, but it seems the blame is being placed on the system more than the parents when it should be the other way around. Unfortunately, you can‚Äôt expect the outside world to parent your children for you. It‚Äôs not safe.', 'This is a really good podcast so far. I‚Äôm glad Relisha‚Äôs story is being told more in-depth here. She was failed in so many different ways. The story is heartbreaking but one that must be told again and again.', 'I couldn‚Äôt stop listening! I really appreciate for not forgetting her story!üòò', 'This story is so heartbreaking I don‚Äôt know what to think whom to blame it‚Äôs just heartbreaking I can‚Äôt believe this actually happened and I‚Äôm in the DMV area and this is my first time listening to a podcast and hearing this story just when you‚Äôve thought you figured out what happen to her more information is being released so you have to questions EVERYONE this story is well put together Im still only on the first episode #J4RR', 'The speaker does a beautiful job telling one of the most important stories of our lifetime. Through the Cracks is a story we should all listen to.', 'Very well produced and important subject matter told by a personable & thoughtful host. These stories need to be heard, and so often they are not told, overlooked or forgotten. Where is Relisha?!', 'I really enjoyed it so far. I do wish we could hear from the mother and get her side of the story. I do wonder where the money she was given to pay rent was going and why she wasn‚Äôt cooperating with the police', 'It is the responsibility of every parent to ensure the health and safety of their children. Was this preventable? Absolutely- by the parent. The federal government or city government is not a parent. Pathetic to blame poor parenting on anyone but a parent.', 'Looking forward to the next episodes.', 'This podcast is one all should listen to. We can come to understand what the hiccups and deep seeded issues in our system are. \n\nI have been waiting all week for the new episode to be available. This is great work- very objective and so informational. Love all the different peoples perspectives. Thank you for all your hard work in putting this together.', 'I hope they find the lil one', 'Fantastic podcast. Refreshing. No politics or fake b.s. Great job so far.', 'This is an important podcast, but I sometimes have to turn it off because of the repetitive music loop. It‚Äôs very frustrating and takes me right out of the story. Can you consider varying it up and/or forget the music. Thanks.', 'I take notes and I find as something to do during the day it‚Äôs so good', 'Love every minute of this podcast!', 'Binge-worthy. Beautifully done. What a way to honor Ralisha.', 'Daws you into the families life; raw and non-judge-mental, this interview showed me myself (not at that level of misfortune) but at any socio-economic level any of us could be any one of the family members -especially when We take  a deep look into our life and how we connect with our family. We are our brother‚Äôs keeper, Black people need to get better in building community.', 'Thank you for this.

I‚Äôll pass', 'This podcast is a MUST LISTEN, I was familiar with Relisha‚Äôs case but I love how much humanity the host gives her back.', 'Stumbled upon this, I enjoyed the first two episodes. I look forward to hearing more! The narrators voice is pleasant on the ears and the subject matter is interesting, albeit a sad story.', 'In-depth look at the effects of systemic racism, families, generational trauma, and resilience.', 'I am incredibly thankful that Ms. Hill is telling the world about Relisha. I lived across from Payne Elementary when she went missing and I was heartbroken by what happened to her. It is unacceptable to me that we still don‚Äôt have answers. Thank you, Ms. Hill, for shinning a light on this beautiful little girl and telling her story.', 'So good and so critical! Best podcast I‚Äôve heard since Serial. The most absorbing and also the most important listen that I‚Äôve experienced.', 'This is so important and so beautifully captured. What a painful and gripping story.', 'I‚Äôm so thankful Ms. Hill is spotlighting the disappearance of Relisha Rudd ‚Äî a beautiful little brown girl with an infectious smile. And it is because she is a little brown girl that makes this feature so important because her disappearance never garnered the same type of national news coverage that little white girls receive. Plus it highlights the breakdown in a system that is suppose to protect children and provided layers of safety nets, failed on every level. #NeverForget', 'This is so well reported and captivating. As an unfortunate contributor to DC‚Äôs gentrification I think this story should be mandatory listening for anyone who has moved to DC in the past ten years and all young professionals living in the city....!', 'After the first episode, I am loving this series. So rarely are these types of stories told. Maybe this series can be instructive to prevent another such tragedy. Can‚Äôt wait for the next episode!!!', 'This podcast not only tells a story, but brings you into the lives of those who are living it. It tugs at the heart strings, and challenges our society. This is a must-listen for anyone who is interested in our justice system, and a thought-provoking perspective on how we handle crime.', 'Jonquilyn Hill is a true storyteller. Through the Cracks is gripping investigative journalism at its best reported with passion and reflection. \n\n- GM', 'I‚Äôve been wanting someone to cover Relishas case. Thank you!!!', 'This is such an important story to tell, and Through the Cracks is doing it right. I wish every episode was out now so that I could binge it because I‚Äôm riveted.', 'Can‚Äôt wait to see how this season unfolds. It‚Äôs certainly the result of thorough investigative journalism.']"

I love how down-to-earth and candid Dr Santos is. She freely admits to the things she struggles with, which makes her so relatable and genuine. The findings that she shares and suggestions she proposes have been studied and proven to be effective but yet are simple enough for anyone to understand and try on their own. And she is great at extracting wonderful information and advice from her wide range of guests.  Thank you, Dr Santos, for doing all the homework on our behalf and distilling down a ton of studies, research and knowledge for our benefit!

Usually not an uplifting way to commence the day. After listening to one episode I have just a wee bit more hope for humanity. I think I‚Äôll be a bit more positive and motivated to bring some light, for myself and the world.', 'I have enjoyed listening to this podcast. I appreciate the thought processes and it being a refreshing way to view various subjects. I have deeply appreciated the recent mini series on self compassion. Please keep these great episodes coming!', 'I loved listening to this and learning how happiness can be achieved rather than simply striking lucky on it.', 'So insightful, so practical, so well-researched, and also presented in a way that makes learning to be happier entertaining and fun! I love this podcast! I am so impressed that I am also taking Laurie Santos‚Äôs The Science of Well-Being class (available for free on Coursera) which I highly recommend.', 'Found Dr. Laurie Santos through her episode on Armchair Expert and I subscribed immediately. I just started listening and have loved every episode so far. Exactly the podcast I needed!', 'I would be much happier if I didn‚Äôt have to listen to ads pushing a fake final speech by a former president. Annoying! The election was last November. Let‚Äôs move on. The podcast itself is very good and informative.', 'I listened to the episode ""The War for Kindness."" I\'ll listen to more, because the beginning of the episode was interesting and easy to connect to.\n\nShe talked about how group identity can lead people to ""other"" different groups, and that we have a lack of empathy for the ""other."" \n\nAs someone who lived in Africa for years and tried to garner empathy from my American neighbors, I love talking to people about this. We tend to care more about our ""group"" than people we see as the ""other."" The pain and suffereing of people from our in-group eliscits more empathy from us than others who don\'t look or believe like us. So it\'s up to us to recognize our biases and try to love everyone, not just those who believe/act like us.\n\nThe episode began with so much promise. But instead of talking about these issues broadly, Dr. Santos used it to spark political division. She, in a sense, ""othered"" the other side of the political aisle. She talked about how ""hateful"" those on the right are. She called everyone on the right ""hateful"" and ""racist,"" and gave strategies for how to fix their perspectives.\n\nThe whole epsiode was supposed to be about empathy for others. She othered the right, and talked about how she needed to help the right develop more empathy and inclusion.\n\nI think it\'s time to look inward. Has she ever met anyone on the right who\'s not a ""racist bigot homophobe?"" Does she really think half the country needs to be taught to not hate her, when she clearly hates that half of the country?\n\nFrustrating, because the idea for the episode was so fascinating. Too bad she had the blinders on.\n\nI\'ll listen to more episodes because what she started out talking about was interesting... and maybe it can raise my review. I\'m just so bugged she ""othered"" a whole group of people in an episode that was supposed to be about not ""othering"" out groups. Oh well.', 'I love how each episode gives you some insight as to being happier and the research examples as support. I have been trying to implement some of the provided practices into my life. Loved it so much I shared with all my friends and subscribed to it on Apple Podcast and Spotify. Wish I got to attend a class like this in my college but thankfully, now I can learn about happiness through this podcast!', 'Thank you for bringing evidence-based practices for moving towards happier living!

I love listening to this podcast and pondering how to integrate concepts discussed here into those life decisions.', 'I literally recommend this podcast to everyone I meet.

I have a little pod-club of friends who are starting to listen weekly and discuss what we learned.', 'This series gives a lot of hope - but it also gives a lot of concrete, achievable advice.

Clearly, it‚Äôs research-based, but also incredibly accessible for non-academics. My new favorite!', 'While I enjoy every episode and found the recent one on diversity very good, I notice how engrained is in the American mind the word Race and it‚Äôs derivations. If we want to advance I suggest we eliminate this word from our conversations on the theme. I even noticed you, Laura, describing yourself as ‚Äúbiracial‚Äù.  Let‚Äôs have a huge paradigm change. The R word, like the N word perpetuates our attitudes. We are all homo sapiens, that should be enough.', '1 episode down and excited for more!!!', 'S1: Lockdown and the anxiety the uncertainty COVID brought made our group seek out a positive and uplifting podcast. We needed more happiness in our lives and this podcast served up what the doctor ordered. Dr. Laurie Santos was an incredible host who made you feel like you were sitting right in her lecture hall, which housed the most popular class in the 300 year history of Yale University. The episodes provided profound and thought provoking ideas on how to achieve happiness, which actually simplified the pursuit of it. Dr. Santos‚Äô delivery was captivating and engaging as she made our group discuss how our own actions impacted our happiness and affirmed some of the things we were already doing to contribute to our happiness.

They help me understand so many things in my own life. I use this knowledge daily!', 'Thank you Dr. Laurie Santos for this wonderful podcast on happiness, a goal we all pursue in multitudes paths. I have especially enjoyed the episodes on Ancient Greek philosophy. It would be great if you can do episodes on the philosophy of Vedanta (meaning the ultimate knowledge) conceived in ancient India 10,000 years ago, a base of all regions and most importantly the path to permanent happiness.', 'The Happiness Lab podcast has been one of the best discoveries I‚Äôve made this season. It is engaging, educational and enlightening. Thank you for bringing it to light.', 'Just the first episode gave one very depressed shell of a person hope. \nHope that one day I will be a version of me that once was, before depression. Hope that I am able to get through this. \nMost importantly, I believe in myself again.', 'The best content provided by Dr. Santos is in her interview with Sam Harris. It takes an excellent host to bring out the best of an expert. Some episodes here are good, but there are quite a few that border on being trivial and are in need of some depth.']"

As a huge fan of true crime podcasts I was really excited to listen to this new addition to the exactly right network, but two episodes in and I‚Äôm pretty much done with the story and it‚Äôs delivery. The narrative is bland and there‚Äôs confusion as to where the story conclusions are being drawn from by the narrator? There are parts where she interviews people, but I‚Äôm not sure who she‚Äôs interviewing most of the time? Also, these tiny interview sound bites are more interesting than the narrator herself, and I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm tuning in for a podcast, not an audiobook.\n\nSeason Two: Vastly different and better than the first season!

But I tend to gravitate much more to the older ones, before the 20th century, and that‚Äôs very hard to find in a sea of 1970s and 1980s stories.

Some ways that we can begin to chase God without fully knowing it is: Depending on church for an interaction with God. Listening to Christian podcasts, sermons, music, etc. every second of the day until it all just turns into noise. Going to conferences like Sadie said.

As someone who has played football and suffered from concussions, the lack of evidence and clearly misinformed researchers was extremely gross. The story was turned from talking about how players had suffered from this awful disease and that the league had tiptoed around for decades, to a story about race. You literally said that someone‚Äôs severe injury to their brain was less important because they were white and that the league only avoided the issue because of race. While I am sure that race had some impact on their decisions at the time. Disregarding a person's deadly disease, such as CTE, because they are/were ‚Äúwhite and had more privileges because of it‚Äù is extremely disgusting and disappointing. Everyone involved in this episode and this podcast should be extremely disappointed in themselves. Shame on you."", 'If you enjoy conspiracy theories from the liberal point of view, this is the right podcast for you.

Annoying.', 'My mother makes me listen', 'The most recent four part Oklahoma City bombing episode is the most blatant propaganda ever. Not only does it not talk about the conspiracy theory around it but it is a topic they already covered. The only reason for doing this right now is because of what is going on currently in the country and to demonize anyone right wing. Carter Roy is a leftist and anti trump guy. Check out his youtube channel. It‚Äôs literally just vids of him pretending to be hitler as trump. Insane he of all people would do this pod. If you have done any research of your own on a lot of these you can see this podcast for exactly what it is: people who might be 50/50 on certain conspiracy theories check this podcast out thinking they are being cool and going down a rabbit hole. Then these Purveyors of propaganda try to convince them there‚Äôs really nothing to the story. Sure after hearing the whole story it seems like about 90% chance there was a conspiracy involved but since there ‚Äú is no actual proof‚Äù we have to give it a two out of 10. So basically nothing is ever proven. If it was then you could easily Google it and you would know since it‚Äôs already a fact and you would have no reason to even listen to this podcast. Idiots!', 'Good podcast with good information. I see a lot of people saying they‚Äôre ‚Äúbiased‚Äù or ‚Äúsensationalize‚Äù but I don‚Äôt agree with that. They have fun with the drama of the topics and share from all sides. My one issue is that Molly‚Äôs voice sounds a little robotic.', ""1. all the other reviews are talking about the hosts voices which ya they are very stiff & carters random inflections on words is annoying but not worthy of leaving a bad review 2. BUT why the heck do they rate every conspiracy theory at 2-3/10 ...... like i just listened to the mozart one & salieri literally said he poisoned mozart on his death bed and they said the theory was 2/10 like cmonnnn it might not be true but like at least give it a 5 if he ADMITTED to it...its like 2 people who have never ever believed a conspiracy theory just saying they don't believe any ever that's kinda annoying....one thing i really like about Ashley Flower's Supernatural podcast is that she gives the benefit of the doubt for EVERY theory bc its more fun that way"", 'Some stories are great but then you let your left show. Everything blamed on ‚Äúfar right‚Äù is tiring. I know that‚Äôs the world we live in today and we have to overlook some of it for entertainment purposes.', 'Material covered is entertaining, though slightly sensationalized and dramatized. I do enjoy it, but the voices of the host are a little annoying... Carter seems to emphasize or add unneeded inflection on random words or phrases. It wouldn‚Äôt hurt him to even out his tone a little. Molly‚Äôs volume level seems to fluctuate considerably, with it typically at a normal level but sometime tailing off to just above a whisper. All in all, it‚Äôs pretty good if you can tolerate their voices.']"

I wish you and your families all the best.', 'This show would be 10000000x better without bill', 'Only Netflix special I‚Äôve ever stopped early, Brent‚Äôs terrible and unfunny and his fake laugh kills babies. Racist stinky dog banger.', 'Bert not understanding how the financial crisis impacted nascar is the kind of ignorance I come here for', 'He needs to become more comfortable with silence, and allowing others to go through a conversation. The amount of time he derails something with other stories all about him or just straight up not knowing what he‚Äôs talking about.', 'If you don‚Äôt love bill burr you are way to serious a person!!!', 'I like both of these guys but NO ONE wants to listen to Bert eating during the podcast. Be a professional even if it‚Äôs a comedy podcast. Interrupting epic stories to answer your text and eat or to tell a different story is just childish.', 'These reviews are cringe. I love Bert, I love Bill, I love this show. Keep it up guys!', 'You‚Äôll probably find this podcast to be not the best match. With this podcast you get bill talking about everything he talks about on his Monday morning podcast while Bert listens. It‚Äôs not the two bears one cave dynamic,  bert is much more reserved and doesn‚Äôt act like a doofus like he does around Tom.', 'I can‚Äôt take when Bert speaks. Does he not realize who he‚Äôs sitting with? Bill Burr! a comedic genius is interrupted continuously? for example; interrupting  for a story about Tampa? Nobody cares!  I‚Äôm giving it a 5 star because Burr is involved, but it‚Äôs really unfortunate he didn‚Äôt pair up with someone on his level intellectually.', 'I started listening when it first came out (or back? idk, it was about 6 months ago it seems) and then Bert‚Äôs idiocy kept becoming more and more obvious and less and less funny. I stopped listening about 2 months ago and already feel smarter for not having to listen to Bert mispronounce commonly known words or pretend not to know basic information. Hearing him chewing is god awful as well.\n\nThe saving grace is Bill Burr but that‚Äôs not enough to get me to listen any more so I just listen to the Monday Morning Podcast. You rock, Bill!', 'If you want to hear Bill and Bert shame averave working people while talking about buying flights on private planes this is the show for you. Elitist hacks.', 'I listen while doing my walks during the day. I have earbuds in so nobody can hear what I am listening to. These guys crack me up so much I am laughing out loud and I get strange looks from passers by.', 'Burt is so stupid he describes Joe Rogan as intelligent, Bill is not much brighter ughhh', 'I‚Äôve been listening to this podcast since its beginning because Bill Burr is hands down my favorite comedian (i had never heard of Burt before though). \n\nFor a while, this show had me in stitches, start to end of each episode.\n\nThe past couple of weeks/months, however, the comedy has been lacking and I‚Äôve had a tougher time listening to it recently.\n\nI realize this is a new duo doing a new show in the middle of a pandemic and economic recession, so what I‚Äôm about to say is out of love because i really want this show to succeed. So here it goes...\n\n1. Burt, I don‚Äôt wanna hear about how ‚Äúfamous‚Äù you want the audience to think you are, all the famous ‚Äúfriends‚Äù you want us to know you have, or the advertisements of yourself/your sponsors that you unsuccessfully weave into your discussions with Bill, as if the audience won‚Äôt notice. Your lack of authenticity, shame, and humility is getting worse with each episode, and sometimes i wanna vomit when you speak....and it seems like Bill can‚Äôt stomach talking to you either sometimes.\n\n2. I love stand up comedy. So I‚Äôve tried listening to other comedians‚Äô podcasts but I cant ever get on board. Why? Because all they and their guests talk about it is the ins and outs of the comedy/standup industry, and it‚Äôs just too insider-baseball and full of industry lingo for a general audience to enjoy. It‚Äôs fine occasionally in small portions, but I don‚Äôt understand or frankly care about an industry overview and analysis for 1+ hours at a time without much to laugh at at all. I want to laugh about things that I have some semblance of connection to, or can relate to in some way, like i do during your sets on stage/TV. So Bill and Burt, i beg of you...please reign in your insider chatter about the comedy industry (especially when you have guests). I turn to you guys religiously every week looking for a sliver of comic relief and brief escape from what‚Äôs otherwise a sh*t time for the modern world. \n\n3. Bill...thank you for the good person that you are, your humility, authenticity, vulnerability with your audience, and especially your humor. I only ask that you stop being so hard on yourself...but then again, maybe that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre all those great things i mentioned above.']"

Yay!) worldview is much needed in this time that champions moral relativity. Give it a listen and you will not be disappointed.', 'Love listening to this podcast, Allie is a ray of hope in the world we live in!', 'Allie die a great job of looking at news from a Christian world view.  I like her bold, no-nonsense approach to an ever changing secular culture.', 'Thank you for speaking TRUTH!', 'This is the first review I have ever written for a podcast, actually the first review of anything I have had the opportunity to write a review for. I usually just click the stars and leave it at that. I haven‚Äôt been listening to Allie for more than 3 months, but I have been listening to podcasts of many variety for about two years. Allie‚Äôs podcast is humble, encouraging, and has personally ignited a passion in me that leads me to crave truth and biblical knowledge. This has strengthened my courage as a believer and given me much hope. This podcast is not just for Christians or Republicans. I would strongly encourage anyone and everyone to listen, reflect and continue to seek further truth, even fact check any of her topics that she touches on, as she encourages her followers to do. Truly this podcast is engaging and productive and I‚Äôm thankful to be able to listen to it. Thank you Allie! \n\nShelbie V', 'I really enjoy hearing your perspective on current issues from a biblical standpoint. It is nice to hear how and why looking to the Bible is important when addressing current stories! Thanks Allie Beth!', 'Allie delivers honest, consistent, straightforward analysis and answers to current issues with a side of sarcasm when needed. Really enjoy every episode of this podcast, and highly recommend you give it a listen.', 'Alie is a treat to listen to. She‚Äôs very educated, articulate and honest.', 'Thanks ABS, for all the wonderful work you do to get the deets out and present them through a theologically sound lens! I recommend you to all my friends (and even the high school/college girls I know)!', 'I find this podcast to be extremely condescending and bitter/angry in tone. It is also extremely biased. Anything that goes against what she says is immediately dismissed as stupid/evil. Does not like to be challenged. Overall I agree with some things she says, but mostly she comes across as a cruel person with very little empathy for people that come from different backgrounds. Lastly, any posts on school choice leave out a lot of information! It‚Äôs obvious she‚Äôs spent very little, if any time in a public school.', 'Brilliant!  Enjoyed hearing what both Lila Rose and Allie had to say!  And the monologue... more power to you!  Brava!', 'So sad to hear/see her anti-LGBTQ, anti-progressive, anti-choice, anti-mental health perspective is accepted and cheered by so many.  It‚Äôs so disappointing to know so many people follow and support her.', 'Allie Beth does an amazing job thoughtfully unpacking tough topics through a Christian worldview. She is leaned in to the community of listeners & clearly values creating meaningful content for how we can best love our families, our neighbors, and approach all areas of life in a God-honoring posture. Highly recommend her podcast & following her on social media! Keep up the great work.', 'Her way or the highway on everything. Has to be not just Christian but her brand. Not just GOP but ultra right wing. Very self unaware. Wants to sound intellectual but comes across as a school girl. Waste of time.', 'This woman would love to live in a Christian Theocracy. She doesn‚Äôt have an original thought in her right wing brain. Listened twice and will never listen again. Doesn‚Äôt believe in science. Everything is abortion, LGBTQ, CRT snd it is all talking points and hate. Airhead.', 'I really enjoy listening to Allie. I appreciate her willingness to consider differing opinions and I appreciate that she always refers back to Scripture and desires to know what God says about certain issues. Also, I always love the bit of encouragement at the end of her episodes. That‚Äôs what fellow believers and the church can do for each other, right?? Truth and encouragement! Keep it up, Allie!', '...Allie Beth is a voice of reason! It can be very discouraging to turn on the news or scroll through social media and think sanity is a thing of the past. I look forward to this podcast daily! It‚Äôs refreshing to stay updated on current events and also hear biblical truths.', 'Her podcast is amazing', 'love this podcast', 'I agree with many of her views and thoughts on the current political climate. However, I recently found that she is referencing false and biased information when it comes to religion. She is entitled to opinions of course. But to send people asking for information to biased sources is wrong. As she always says-do your own research and go to the source!', 'Encouraging, fantastic, deeply informative! And definitely follow her on Instagram and YouTube, it‚Äôs a worthy investment to listen and participate in her stuff.', 'Allie does such an amazing job talking about politics with facts and an even better job tying politics and social issues into Christianity. Love that there‚Äôs four episodes a week. Worth the listen!', 'She claims to be a Christian but she actively discredits other Christian religions and is not kind about it either. Refuses to look to the sources or give the benefit of the doubt when it comes to other religions that she does not understand. She‚Äôs not like this with anything else. Just religion. It‚Äôs her way or it‚Äôs completely wrong. As a Christian, I can only say ‚ÄúYikes‚Äù.', 'As Allie wrote, optics matter but unfortunately she doesn‚Äôt practice what she preaches. Not very original and one can tell that she regurgitates her viewpoints on politics from Ben Shapiro. In additions, I‚Äôm starting to wonder if she really does believe what she preaches because she isn‚Äôt very humble.', 'Enjoy listening to it during my daily exercise. Christian-based positive encouragement at the end of (every?) episode is a big plus for me. Keep up the excellent work, please. \nThank you.', 'I‚Äôm a mother of four, and I enjoy so much listening to Allie all the time! My husband and I pray for knowledge, wisdom and understanding daily and I think your podcast has helped me so much with getting the information I need every day. I feel I can trust what you say and your judgement on the people you have on your show. Thank you so much for putting so much effort into this, it definitely shines through when I listen every day!', 'Allie - THANK YOU for all you do! I look forward to listening to your podcasts every week. I love how you help keep me connected to what is going on in the world, and always try to share positive truth. Finding you has been one of the best things to come from 2020! You‚Äôre such a blessing!', 'It is encouraging and refreshing to hear a podcast where the host speaks honest truth while proclaiming her Christian faith. Me. Stu key has a heart of passion and conviction that most podcast hosts lack. This is one of my favorite podcasts and I look forward to every episode.', 'I haven‚Äôt ever been into podcasts, or politics before this one! I was gifted Allie‚Äôs book, You‚Äôre Not Enough (and that‚Äôs okay), which led me to Relatable. I absolutely LOVE Allie‚Äôs biblical perspective and she truly makes politics, current events, and important things... RELATABLE. I am grateful for finding this outlet as it has given me a backbone and confidence in having conversations about topics I was never confident in before. I literally can‚Äôt rave enough!', 'Allie is consistent in her moral standards when applied to politics, or anything else! Love you Allie!!üíúüíú', 'Love this podcast!', 'Thank you for speaking truth so boldly and with such passion and yet with such love and grace.\n\nIn your latest podcast, however, I do want to say that I think your comparison of Ted Cruz to Gavin Newsom, or any of the other politicians you mentioned, was not a fair comparison. He did not tell people not to do something and then went and did it anyway. Those politicians told people not to go out in public or not to get together with friends or not to go visit their grandmother for a holiday gathering, and then they all did the exact opposite. Although I do not Think that Ted Cruz should‚Äôve gone to Cancun, I just wanted to point out it wasn‚Äôt logical to compare him to those others who were being hypocrites. \n\nOtherwise, THANK YOU for seeking Truth!', 'Love Allie. She‚Äôs intelligent & feisty. Lethal combo.', 'This podcast really keeps me grounded. In a world going crazy, I love that Allie educates us on all kinds of current topics all the while reminding us to trust in God and stay faithful to Him. I listen to every episode I can, while I get ready in the morning or make meals for my family. I have become much more confident when I‚Äôm in conversations with people about the craziness in our world and can offer insights that I‚Äôve learned in her show. I‚Äôve recommended it to countless friends, too!', 'Allie- thank you for your boldness and your willingness to speak biblical truth even in the difficulties of our current climate. Even though I don‚Äôt agree on everything, I always appreciate hearing your perspective and am challenged to think critically and see the Lord when looking at politics. Thanks for using your voice in such a powerful way!!', 'By far the best podcast out there. Allie perfectly balances truth and logic with all of the events going on today. She truly feels like a friend after listening to a few podcasts and she is a voice of reason for today‚Äôs generation. So grateful for her during these crazy times.', 'Awesome! Thank you for your Christian conservative viewpoint. I pray your podcast keeps growing. We need a louder and more young conservative voices during these times', 'Overall I‚Äôve loved her podcast, however when I heard something that was off and then privately messaged her from a loving/concerned listener, she was very defensive and harsh. Very un-Christian.  She invites her listeners to come to her if she says something wrong or ‚Äúoff‚Äù, but yet when confronted, she very much does not welcome the constructive criticism. It was a disheartening exchange (to say the least) to experience as a Christian, when you think you‚Äôre reaching out in love and concern and your words are twisted and you end up being attacked...Very unfortunate.', 'Allie is great at breaking down social, political and cultural content and always brings it back to a Biblical worldview.', 'In a world and a society that is becoming more and more misled by lies, misinformation, hatred, ungodliness, self-righteousness, personal feelings over Truth and Facts, it is a big encouragement to hear someone talk about politics and other social and biblical issues from a clearly ‚Äúwhat does the Bible have to say about this‚Äù standpoint. I get tired of hearing about wickedness and watching the news and it‚Äôs misinformation, so it is refreshing to be able to hear about these things and what God and Truth have to say about them. Thank you.', 'Fun, interesting, and intelligent. Thank you. Hope you don‚Äôt get censored.', 'Terrible in every way. What a disappointment', 'Allie has such a gift for tying thoughts together and processing through things in a fresh, logical, conservative Christian perspective. I enjoy the longer episodes- the more content from Allie, the better!', 'My absolute favorite podcast! Allie Beth does a wonderful job of discussing a variety of topics and how we should approach them as Christians. Thank you Allie Beth for all you do! It is so appreciated! ‚ù§Ô∏è', 'ABS has a lot of truth and I‚Äôve listened for years, and been so encouraged by her focus on politics but from the Christian perspective. So glad I found her. If I was going to give any feedback, I‚Äôm going to pull back on listened bc her tone and cadence is hard for me to listen to. Almost every syllable seems to go up in pitch and it makes for a pleading, sing songy listen. I realIze content is the most important and I do love me some abs, but this platform is only audio, and I‚Äôm struggling w that.', 'As a young conservative I love this podcast! Would highly recommend!', 'This podcast has challenged me and encouraged me. Thank you so much, Allie, for ministering to so many people with the truth.', 'I have tried to send this many times and I haven‚Äôt seen it. All that aside, I‚Äôm highly offended by the things I have heard Allie say on here. She is nothing but an anti LGBT, anti Semitic white supremacist and is pretty much against anything or anyone that is not white, straight, Christian, cisgender, or republican. Allie, if you are reading this, you have blood on your hands.', 'I am so thankful for all I‚Äôve learned through this podcast, but I cannot keep up with the content; it‚Äôs too much.', 'This podcast is my absolute favorite to listen to and learn from. 100% relatable and such a joy to hear what a young female Christian conservative thinks about important issues facing our families, country and the world. Keep up the fantastic work, Allie! üëèüèº‚úùÔ∏èüá∫üá∏']"

In 2013,  the school nurse and I, as mandated reporters, made a report to CPS for a tiny 6 year old non-verbal student who had too many scratches and bruises all over his body in addition to some behavior changes we and others observed for a couple of months. I didn‚Äôt hear anything from CPS. \n\nAt the beginning of the following school year, I asked a teacher friend how he was doing. (He had moved and was at a different school.) She kept avoiding answering the question. I badgered her until she told me that he had passed away during the summer. WHAT?! I went to the internet and found the obituary. He died in the June following the school year we made the report.

I was disheartened to learn that he was this difficult to stop and the many lives that he recklessly destroyed. The physicians that operated to mend his botched surgeries were heroic because they fought to stop him from butchering more victims.

I am healthcare worker and a mother, my husband is an orthopedic surgeon and father of our children and this was one of the most emotional podcast series I‚Äôve listened to, my husband was so appalled he declined to listen  based on what I told him. We must all commit to making a difference. This has inspired  me to do just that. ‚ù§Ô∏è', 'This podcast does an excellent job reporting the gaps with Child protection investigations.', 'Amazing podcast.

Don‚Äôt waste you‚Äôre time.', 'After listening to this podcast, I have the strong urge to contact my representatives and talk about how there needs to be a major reform of the current system. This podcast should be required listening for anyone training to become a social worker, case worker for CPS, pediatrician and especially the trainees for the CAP fellowships. Excellent reporting and very important to tell this story.', 'Love  anything by Wondery! They can‚Äôt keep up with my podcast madness! ü§£ \n\nThis topic needed to be said! Thanks to the people who pushed this topic, did the work and research to share this podcast! \n\nWe want kids to be safe but we also want competent people making these decisions, from physicians, social workers, to CPS case workers,  etc..  \n\nBoth families were tortured! It was heart wrenching to listen üéß at times. Cannot believe how long they allowed the parents and kids to go through this unnecessary separation. Way too long! All for nothing.

Sometimes the systems we trust so completely in are deeply flawed. It's time that some changes are made."", 'As I listen to this podcast I am sickened by the reckless behavior of the CPS officials involved! Seems like their main focus is not the welfare of children but protecting themselves at the cost of innocent families. This obviously is a problem across the board with CPS while 100‚Äôs of children are legitimately being abused. Lavar Jones and Neisha Edwards need to be arrested!', 'Terrifically reported on what a terrifying reality these and so many families are living through senselessly!', 'I start 100 podcasts and only continue listening to maybe half of what I start.

I hope Texas Children‚Äôs Hospital and their ‚Äúchild abuse pediatricians‚Äù learn from this. And the CPS and justice system. \nGreat podcast!!', 'Haven‚Äôt even finished listening yet, but hoping the CPS employees are punished for their reckless behavior.', 'A look into how CPS wrongly accused two families. Be prepared to be angry at a system that continues to fail children and families in more ways than one.', 'Illuminates a part of the world that most of aren‚Äôt aware of.', 'These two families‚Äô stories are told so well and shine a light on how the system can go so wrong. I really hope CPS across all states examine their policies! And pediatric CA specialists!', 'I‚Äôve never been so angry listening to a podcast! As an ex CPS worker, the system is broken!', 'The Butler & Bright story was great in highlighting their stories. It was also balanced journalism with the challenges that exist in the system. \nI am a CASA volunteer in Montgomery county. Montgomery county is one of the leading CASA‚Äôs IN TX and the country.

So interesting; I binged all 6 episodes!', 'This story touched our hearts. We are a same sex couple, we are married and have been raising our children together for 11 years. We are both in education and nothing mattered. Our 13 year old  daughter got CPS involved and made false accusations about us. CPS came into our lives, they separated our 2 children that got taken away, they wanted us to get a divorce and we are still fighting. Our daughters lies got her placed in a RTC and from there on out...they took our family apart piece by piece. Thanks for sharing your stories, now we know we are not alone.', 'This podcast is informative, horrifying, inspiring, and heartbreaking. The stories of so-called doctors and CPS case workers who  are prone to witch hunts are incredibly hard to hear. I think everyone who is even thinking of working on behalf of children should be required to listen to this podcast. The government needs to be held in check, and CPS workers must be better trained and qualified.', 'For starters, Mike does amazing work and is so easy to listen too. He does this story justice. I know there are so many other parents who have faces similar issues. Highly recommend this pod', 'Scary to hear. My daughter, now almost 17 years old.... was a baby with colic.

A lot of faux doctors, cps workers and lawyers in these negative reviews. lol\n\nThis podcast was excellent. I‚Äôve worked in and around cps for many years and these stories are so true. Innocent families being traumatized in the process of trying to prevent harm to children. Race is a huge factor between the bright family and the Butlers. The parallels are very obvious, that and families of color are disproportionately reported over white families. This podcast was eye opening, infuriating, heartbreaking and so accurate to the United States broken CPS system.', 'after all the true crime i listened to this is a story from a perspective i‚Äôve never heard... great listen!!üëçüëç', 'I hope you‚Äôre making lots of money with this trash at the expense of those of us who have to fight back awful memories every time I hear the promos for this freaking podcast.

This will definitely make you mad, but this story needs to be told !', 'Compelling and interesting story... until it was suddenly turned into a story of the almighty, heroic Democrat being voted in to save the day. I think it would do more justice to parallel the two stories without suggesting inherent racism. The moral of the story is that the media sensationalizing the original failures of CPS led to a larger failure within the system.', 'Great podcast, very well done. \nAll the negative reviews saying they ‚Äúliked the podcast until they talked about race‚Äù are very upsetting. I‚Äôm willing to bet all those reviewers are white.', 'My family has recently been faced with having 6 children removed from our safe clean and loving home.

I‚Äôd love to speak with you or someone in your company about airing our story as well. There is a law suit that will take place once the Chins closes.', 'I feel for these parents.

This podcast has been an amazing opportunity for me to do that. I have learned SO much, and my reading of the Bible has transformed as a result of this pod and their videos. I‚Äôm reading through the Bible in a year with their program now. You could say John, Tim, and the rest of the BP crew have changed my life in very Kingdom-of-God ways. I‚Äôm eternally grateful.', 'This is by far my favorite podcast to listen to. I have fallen more in love with Jesus and His Word because of listening and I can‚Äôt think of any higher praise than that.

My daughters and I are using it to get together and discuss.  My goodness!  Bibleproject has so many ways for people to engage with the Bible and with others.

These conversation bring to life The story and make me want to learn more about Jesus, the Bible, history and humanity. The tone of the conversations allows you to enter and be confronted without feeling defensive.

I have studied the Bible for years and these pods are some of my favorite listens. Thank you Bible Project!', 'I love the Bible Project especially their podcast. They have so many excellent resources available for everyone. Thank you for your ministry.', 'This has been transformative in helping me understand the Bible. From the word studies to the discussion of narratives and motifs and themes, it has made me excited, challenged, and hopeful.', 'As approachable and easy to understand as their videos are, the podcast unfortunately takes a strong divergent. The discussion is super deep, lengthy (over an hour) and in my opinion, over the head of the audience they are trying to reach. Growing up in the church, I would consider myself somewhat knowledgeable about Bible topics, but find it hard to follow the discussions. If you‚Äôre into biblical theology, this could be the perfect podcast for you, but if you are new to faith or looking to grow from a basic knowledge, I would look elsewhere.', 'Lacking any true explanation of the cross as a propitiation, false dichotomies and even passive acceptance of the deeply flawed CRT tenants...skip it and find a better podcast.', 'Love how they communicate effectively the lense in which the biblical authors were using while being inspired by God to write scripture.', 'I thoroughly enjoy the Bible Project! It makes me pay attention and look more closely when I am reading the Bible. \n\nMost recently I loved the visual that the Reading the Psalms video gave that when we read it is entering into the presence of God looking forward to the future of hope of being in the temple of God when Jesus returns - while we are living in a miserable world now. \n\nThen I loved the Character of God series. I loved how it showed what God says about himself and the OT authors say about him repeatedly. \n\nAll in all, in all the videos, podcasts and such I love how it shows to let the Bible speak for itself and define words for itself instead of being quick to enter our definitions and interpretations.', 'These guys have great solid theological content. Unfortunately both hosts have a way of talking where they get super quiet towards the end of their sentences. So it‚Äôs close to impossible to actually catch I could portion of what they are saying. The only way to hear what they are saying at the end of their sentences is to listen to the podcast at a high volume, which makes half of what they‚Äôre saying super loud. I wish they could either adjust their levels, or not get quiet at the end of each sentence. Been trying for a year to listen to them, but might give up due to this.', 'BibleProject offers weekly conversations about the Christian Scriptures. As a pastor, I constantly recommend this podcast as an accessible, honest, energetic, and engaging entryway into critically reading the text. Tim Mackie wears his scholarship with humility, drawing insights from the original languages, innumerable scholarly works, and the literary design patterns within the text itself. Jon Collins reframes their conversations with the perceptive questions and fearless honesty. And, most significantly, they never allow the discussions to remain in the realm of trivia. Instead the text becomes a constant invitation to behold Jesus and live under his reign. This is podcasting at its most insightful and most redemptive.', 'I like most TBP content! Unfortunately, the ‚ÄúGod or gods?‚Äù episode is to me a bit of a rambling mess. I do appreciate that the guys are trying to understand a difficult concept along with the listeners - even if poorly executed.', 'I‚Äôm a recent subscriber but have learned so much in just a handful of episodes so far.

Keep up the good work.', 'What a wonderful explanation of Hebrew and Greek to give a better view of our English translations!', 'I love these podcasts and discussions between Tim and Jon!  They are helping me learn how to think well and puzzle out challenging ideas. I especially like the way that Tim presents an idea or concept and then Jon restates it and works his way to understanding it through insightful questions, clarifications, and analogies. I have learned so much about the Bible, it‚Äôs literary structure, the meaning of the original Hebrew words, the worldview of the writers, it‚Äôs all fascinating! It‚Äôs increased my desire to read the Bible and broadened my wonder at how amazing it is! Thank you so much!!! I also love the music playing in each episode, how can I get the music so I can listen to it anytime?', 'I‚Äôve learnt so much through this podcast!!', 'Editing review for the simple reason that their theology is pretty biased. It‚Äôs not based on what the Bible says but what they think it means. There are so many verses I can think of that refute the things they talk about in some episodes I can‚Äôt really recommend it as accurate anymore. But I do think it‚Äôs important to critically think about others beliefs and finding your own. So keep in mind they may not be theologically sound but you should read and study for your own \n\nThese guys do a wonderful job diving into meanings and literary tools used in the Bible. I differ in opinion to some things they talk about as far as doctrine, but because it‚Äôs non denominational people talking about the Bible it doesn‚Äôt surprise me and it doesn‚Äôt stop me from learning new things. For the most part they seem to have an unbiased approach, but some further research needs to be done about how Christianity has developed especially through the beginning of Catholicism (Constantine era) and how that influenced and changed and shaped Christianity to be closer to paganism and different from what the first Christians practiced. Overall, I enjoy this gives me a lot to think about!', 'I really like the two/three as they dive into the Bible together. They keep it approachable for everyone from all walks of life breaking down the original meaning from Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic languages. It brings a completely new light and helps me feel as if I am really starting to understand the Bible and its intricacies.', 'Been listening to them for years. Keep on keeping on. I love Jesus. <3', 'Found their videos on YouTube, beautiful art and fantastic information! Check that out for sure. Since then became a supporter, highly recommend doing so! Keep up the awesome work guys thank you so much for what you do!!!', 'The BibleProject never fails to take deep theological and scholarly concepts and boil them down into something approachable. What is usually such an overwhelming and intimidating subject becomes open and inviting! If you have questions about the Bible, so do these guys! Highest recommendations on this podcast.', 'I was having a really tough time finding resources that were approachable for me as an analytical skeptic. Jon and Tim‚Äôs conversations have helped me find faith in a way that I can actually feel confident for once in what I believe by growing instead of stagnating through a healthy questioning and deeper learning.', 'This is a great blessing to listen to when alone ‚úùÔ∏èüôåüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏èüî•', 'This podcast continues to blow my mind. The dialogue between Tim and John along with the deep dive into scripture will definitely make you look at scripture in a completely new light.', 'Excellent biblical wisdom and insight, minus the cosmology. We know now what they knew then, there is a firmament and the world is not hurtling through space. Please research this', 'Very helpful', 'Tim and John are great together.

Kai gives a great perspective on what‚Äôs happening in the world and a primer on the economics news of the day. \n\nUpdate: however recently, the reporting/journalistic quality has declined.

The second season, pretty good. Now these new episodes... sounds like some stupid overly-dramatized daytime tv crap, which I guess it is now that they‚Äôve been picked up for a network. The hosts go out of their way to harass the supposed ‚Äúpeople of interest‚Äù and then point to the ‚Äúsuspects‚Äù frustrated responses as some kind of proof of hidden rage disguising guilt. Ugh. It‚Äôs just plain bad journalism and it‚Äôs a major bummer because I honestly thought they did good work on the first season. Very disappointed in the direction the UaV folks are going. Feels like a cash grab.', 'Very good start, although after around 5 episodes it felt as if we were recycling the same info for awhile till a arrest has been made. Although Payne never himself brought up dukes name prior, it felt as if Payne was trying to paint himself as the hero who solved the case. Which in fact Payne had very little to do with so other than talking about said case. I think Payne had solid structure for said podcast but wanted to stretch it out for as long as possible tryin to bring in ad revenue hinting at the fact there‚Äôs a ad read about every 5 minutes. Payne himself had very poor interview skills and I was disgusted by the interview he had with Brooke in episode 19 on how he treated her and the way the whole talk with Brooke went down.', 'To be fair, this impression applies to all true crime, but particularly the case for this one. These podcasts are drawn out beyond the entertainment threshold and into self-congratulatory yammering. Neither of the crimes featured on this podcast have been solved. Then why tell the friggin‚Äô story in the first place? Its not just to bring it to light so it can be solved. If that is why, then this guy is 0 for 2. Ultimately both stories left me feeling manipulated. The worst part of all is that these low life scuz buckets become celebrities. Sickening? Positively. Entertaining or educational? Not yet.', 'Couldn‚Äôt put it down till I got to latest episode. Crazy story!!!', 'Excellent, listened to these years ago and still checking for more.', 'I was really hoping for some finality at the end of this, but that is not what you‚Äôll get. Overall it was a very interesting and compelling story. I think that Payne did an outstanding job as usual. Maybe one day we will find out what happened.', 'I listened to season 2 first and then listened to season 1. The host must have really reeled himself in for season 2 because WOW. He seems beyond rude and entitled in season 1, not to mention coming off as a bratty boy when interviewing Brooke (hot tip, you can take the moral high ground without throwing a hissy fit). It was a disturbing listen, almost like he was going through some personal thing and took it out on her. \n\nI‚Äôm not ‚Äúteam Brooke‚Äù by any means, but he really should have recognized what a loose cannon he‚Äôd been instead of doubling down. I definitely lost whatever remaining respect I had for him after that Q&A episode when he defended his treatment of the Brooke interview, and... that was it. My disgust for him officially outweighed the intrigue I felt to know what happened. I‚Äôll just go look for news articles now, thanks. \n\nBeyond all the other reprehensible things others have mentioned, I personally was also sickened when he invited himself into Tara Grinstead‚Äôs old apartment and was surprised to find an ‚Äúolder Black lady, but she was really nice.‚Äù ...What? I agree it‚Äôs surprising that she was nice to you because you‚Äôre ANNOYING!\n\nThe clips he chose to play of Crime Con (‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so cool Payne Lindsey!‚Äù) were unnecessary and indicative of his thinly-veiled false modesty. He definitely loves his horde of fainting female fans a lot if he made a point of playing those audios.\n\nMoving on, he‚Äôs an absurdly bad interviewer, which he surely must realize as he has said multiple times he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt identify as a podcaster.‚Äù Frankly it seems like more false modesty: he‚Äôs just greasing the skids for people to praise him since he‚Äôs such a ‚Äúnewbie.‚Äù I‚Äôm willing to forgive some of his foibles (ie REPEATEDLY asking Brooke ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your point‚Äù when her point was so.... so clear), but also he‚Äôs made several podcasts and should accept that he is... in fact... a podcaster. I get that people are good at different things but YIKES his interviews are hard to listen to particularly in season 1. Why insist on doing something you‚Äôre SO clearly bad at?  You guys know the answer.\n\nBob Ruff‚Äôs stuff is so much better! P.S. it was big of Bob to interview Payne on his ‚ÄúTrue Crime Binge‚Äù podcast and say they‚Äôre ‚Äúsort of involved in the same type of work,‚Äù but please. Bob is podcasting because he truly cares about people and is amazing at hosting, Payne is obviously in it for $$$. For the love of God, Payne, if you‚Äôre going to keep doing this, let someone else take the spotlight.', 'A well completed podcast. I couldn‚Äôt put it down! An easy 5 stars for me.', 'Not just saying this for the cookies (though that would be awesome too). Good job, Payne! I love cold cases.', 'I listen to several true crime podcasts and this is my favorite ! He is concise and covers every possible angle. Love his voice also. 5 stars!', 'Loved it but wondering if they will make more?  Would love them to!', 'Some of the worst audio I‚Äôve heard in a podcast. You can‚Äôt understand a word they say!\nThe main reporter has absolutely no personality in his voice. He sounds bored with his own story. \nThe basis of the story could have been good.', 'Bad .. period. If you have to listen start at episode 7.', 'Listen to In the Dark instead. This show is a mess, unprofessional and amateur. He didn‚Äôt solve the first case but claimed he did. In the Dark is way better, don‚Äôt waste your time', 'I stumbled upon this podcast and started listening. It‚Äôs great! I‚Äôm only on season 1 ep 2, but I can tell this is going to be a binge listen for me. I‚Äôm looking forward to continuing.', 'More please.', 'Keep them coming!!! Hooked from episode 1!!', 'I love this podcast, but I wish he would do more seasons. It‚Äôs very interesting', 'I find Payne to be very rude, unprofessional, and uninteresting. At first I liked this podcast but I feel like they drag the episodes on and on. Never really got good, keep looking.', 'This is by far my favorite podcast by my favorite podcaster. This is the show that got me started to listening to podcasts and the one that others have to live up to! 10/10 ‚ù§Ô∏è', 'Well written and produced I was reeled in from the first episode', 'Incredibly captivating at first. Then the episodes seemed to drag out. The same story and info was repeated episode after episode. Same questions asked. Which I understand is important to clarify points but it got boring. I ended up skipping most q&a episodes as well as case evidence because they just didn‚Äôt move the story or captivate me in any way. \n\nOn Brooke‚Äôs  interview during Season 1, I was done. Payne was absolutely out of line interviewing her in such an aggressive, interrogatory manner. She committed no crime. In fact, she was a prominent figure in getting this case solved. Brooke made clear, valid theories as to why she believed certain acts might have taken place based on the human psyche and her knowledge of the situation. She spoke in a very relatable manner without attempting to validate the actions of those men‚Äôs wrongdoings. \n\nPayne you got it wrong. You didn‚Äôt act like a journalist. You did not act professionally. You let your emotions get the best of you and it was incredibly cringeworthy. \n\nBetter luck next time. Unfortunately, I won‚Äôt be wasting my time to listen', 'Sounds about right discussing voting in GEORGIA.', 'Some of the audio is unbearable. You‚Äôd expect better quality on season 2 but I guess not.', 'I love this podcast - it fits in with my love of true crime. The host is easy to hear and understand. I have two complaints. One is that I don‚Äôt like how the episodes are organized. I have to scroll all over to find episodes. They are out of order and the updates are messy. The other complaint is that it is sometimes difficult to hear/understand what your interviewee‚Äôs are saying. That is not an uncommon issue for podcasts though. Overall, excellent job! I live in Marietta so I feel a bit of a connection when you mention Atlanta and the surrounding areas. I love that you are based in the south. Keep up the tenacity and I look forward to following your work.', 'Very well done, so glad this case was solved!', 'Great podcast!', 'I loved up and vanished and was addicted until episode 19. The way Payne talked to Brooke was disgusting. I was actually really disappointed with the way it all went down. I thought Payne could‚Äôve done so much better with the interview. Quite unfortunate honestly. Everything was 10/10 up until then', 'I was seeking out a new true crime podcast and was recommended this one. This story in season 1 starts as very compelling, but the further I got into it, the unprofessionalism became more and more apparent, to the point where it became unbearable to me. Payne often seemed like he needed to prove his importance in this case, although he hadn‚Äôt investigated or showed any awareness of the real suspects prior to their arrests. The last straw for me was how he spoke to Brooke in episode 18. He was completely unprofessional and degrading to her, and honestly, I regret spending so much of my time listening to this and supporting his work. For someone claiming he was inspired by the likes of Serial, he needs to learn more about how to withhold personal opinion and emotion in interviews.', 'This is a podcast packed with excitement around every corner. However...the constant balancing issues and poor audio quality make it very frustrating to listen to at times. Between turning the volume up and down to catch each different conversation and totally muting it for minutes at a time because the phone calls are unintelligible, this podcast can be frustrating at times. That being said, it didn‚Äôt stop me from binge listening to both seasons.', 'I like the story but it could be done better. The volume is inconsistent between the ads and the actual podcast. I couldn‚Äôt understand some of the phone calls. I didn‚Äôt listen to it all at once and couldn‚Äôt remember who all of the people speaking were, they need to be introduced.', 'I don‚Äôt understand how people like Payne Lindsay can sleep at night, profiting off someone else‚Äôs tragedy. What I‚Äôm talking about is the ads. SO MANY ADS. \n\nI could get into a critique of how this was put together, as there at many flaws... and I agree with whomever suggested editing more. This second season especially could have been about half as long, but my guess is that Payne‚Äôs view on this is something along the lines of ‚Äúmore content, more ad revenue‚Äù.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt nearly as tedious as Dead and Gone (thanks to the absence of Jake Brennan here), so I‚Äôll give it that. \n\nBut like I said, it‚Äôs an interesting story and I‚Äôm glad that maybe this helped with the case. It‚Äôs just a bit of a slog by episode 8', 'Sound quality is painful in a lot of episodes. Phone calls I‚Äôm sure are tough to record but man the gritty sound and severe (and sudden) up and down volume will make your ears bleed', 'There is slow burn and there is...this. Rambling string of interviews with people whose relevance, motives or veracity of recollection are never questioned or contextualized. \nThe dude airing his personal grievances against the his unnamed buddies in ‚ÄúThe Circle is Small‚Äù is laughably bad. That man needs to talk to a therapist, not a journalist. A therapist would at least ask probative questions.', 'This podcast is amazing!! I love the way Payne tells the story with such sincerity and no added drama. The story and those involved are given the spotlight. I can‚Äôt stop listening and I‚Äôm so impressed with the information uncovered in a short amount of time.', 'Good story and Payne/Tenderfoot make some great podcasts, but this isn‚Äôt their best work. \n\nInterviews should have been edited more/summarized. The series was 8-10 episodes too long. Lots of repetition and sensational rabbit holes.\n\nAlso, the producer gives himself way too much credit for bringing resolution to this case. I find this irritating. \n\nStill, interesting case/story. Dr. Maurice Godwin is everything.', 'I loved this podcast! Corruption, cover-up, and lies. \nMy mother grew up in this area of Georgia, she had relatives there and we had been there many times so I could relate to the local of the story. I wish we could find out the complete truth in this story. Very sad and I don‚Äôt feel justice was served. \nLoved this podcast loved listening to Payne Lindsey! Big fan!', 'I love you Payne and I love your podcasts. But if you could please find a more pleasant way to play the phone calls. At least 5-10 minutes of inaudible, painful noise per episode....', 'Great show!!!! Love it! But the podcast itself needs more organization. The shows are all mixed together.', 'This podcast has been the most addicting podcast I‚Äôve listened to.  Payne has a good podcast voice and knows how to keep you on the end of your seat wanting to know more. Recommend 12/10!', 'I wanted to love it but I couldn‚Äôt get past all the music and sound effects in the background.', 'This was turned into a story for entertainment. We all want to know how it really ended and a life was taken.Stick with it and find some justice.', 'Liked the story until episode 19. I will not be listening to anymore of his podcasts. Payne is so incredibly rude to Brooke. She is not responsible for Beau‚Äôs actions. She is struggling with doing the right thing vs protecting the person she loves. She wants to be respected not sensationalized.\n\nPayne is incredibly biased and is playing with peoples lives. He should not be taking his anger at Beau out on Brooke. \n\nAnd to frame Brooke as crazy after Dustin admits to lying? That is literally gaslighting. \n\nAnd to be angry Brooke had a TV interview? Is it a crime for her to want to take control of the narrative?  \n\nAnyway go listen to Counter Clock it is so much better.', 'Get woke, go broke. Bye Felicia', 'I really enjoyed this podcast but it‚Äôs hard to figure out the episode order. I am lost as to what order all these bonus episodes go in or if a new season has started.', 'I listen yes to tons of true crime. I like Payne and I listened to most of season 1. I didn‚Äôt listen to any of the case evidence or the last few episodes. The case is over, what story is left to be told? At least those extra episodes were easy to skip and I didn‚Äôt feel like I missed a gd thing. This show is too slow. I started season 2 but it‚Äôs not arresting (no pun intended). I think Payne does a good job at investigating but the team needs to learn what to summarize, how to tell a story in a reasonable amount of time per week and episodes per season. I‚Äôm bored, next.', 'Couldn‚Äôt stop listening! Enjoyed it so much!', 'I really loved this series the person who wrote ‚Äúcan we say edit‚Äù?   Review ..You‚Äôre an idiot really you are so exhausting looking to belittle is sad. I loved the ups down and learning the inner truth of this story I saw on 48 hours there was so much more to this story and you took us on the ride with you!', 'This guy puts together some masterful material.', 'This podcast is addicting.
