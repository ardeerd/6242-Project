Mental traits such as happiness, calm, generosity, compassion, and connection are not hardwired, unalterable factory settings; they are, in fact, skills that can be trained. On this show, you'll learn how."

1550666283,"The Prompt Us podcast is the honest conversation about modern faith through the eyes of three gen-z guys. Prompt Us aims to fill the largest gap that is blaring in the media industry today. The giant space where the pendulum swings between practical ambition and spirituality. Through the most humorous yet deeply motivational form of banter, us three best bros will offer insight on topics where faith, relationships, and professional life all intersect, encouraging radical personal growth. Ultimately, the podcast is titled “Prompt Us” because every conversation will be prompted by the audience themselves, offering a format that discusses exactly what the audience is hungry to hear but no one else is talking about. Over the years of friendship, our trio has developed a master skill set at skating the line of humor and light heartedness while filling every conversation with the truth, clarity, and motivation that young adults in this generation so desperately desire."

Have you ever watched Bridgerton, The Crown or Downton Abbey and wondered what it's really like to be a Duchess? If so, this is the podcast for you.

Stately homes are manors, palaces, and castles of great historic significance. They were built by the finest architects, adorned with the finest treasures and surrounded by breathtaking landscapes. They homed the most powerful families and, with their wealth and social pedigree, shaped the world we live in today.

Emma grew up far away from the aristocracy but her life changed forever when she married her husband - the 11th Duke of Rutland - and moved into Belvoir Castle. At once Emma became both a Duchess and custodian of one of Britain's most important buildings.

The Duchess wanted to learn more about this world, these homes, and the other empowering women who, just like her, work tirelessly to ensure they see tomorrow. 

In this podcast the Duchess will travel to breathtaking homes, learn the epic tales of their construction, meet the historic figures that walked their halls, hear chilling ghost stories and the heartbreaking tales of romance. All of this whilst getting to know the inspiring, powerful women that work to find the delicate balance between preservation and transformation.

According to Vedanta, God is infinite existence, infinite consciousness, and infinite bliss. The term for this impersonal, transcendent reality is Brahman, the divine ground of being. Yet Vedanta also maintains that God can be personal as well, assuming human form in every age.
Vedanta further asserts that the goal of human life is to realize and manifest our divinity. Not only is this possible, it is inevitable. Our real nature is divine; God-realization is our birthright.
Finally, Vedanta affirms that all religions teach the same basic truths about God, the world, and our relationship to one another."

1509932636,"Planet Earth consists of millions of wildlife species – some of them are visible to us on a daily basis while others live in wild forests or other humanly uninhabitable places. But despite this, each animal has its own biology and possess some unique characteristics which differentiates them from rest of the animal kingdom - be it the long neck of Giraffe, black and white stripes of zebra, huge physical structures of humpback whales, musical notes of a cuckoo bird or the ability to soar high in the sky of an eagle.
 
Animal Gyan is an original podcast series by Chimes Radio – India’s 1st Audio Platform for Kids - where we talk about different animals and their unique features to introduce the wonders of nature to our young listeners. While scientifically animals are divided into 5 different phylum (Invertebrates, Vertebrates, Arthropods, Mollusks and Echinoderms), for the sake of simplicity, we have used a much simpler categorization of Land (terrestrial), Water (aquatic)  and Air (aerial) animals. This book of knowledge in audio format provides children with an overview of some of the most popular animals from each of these categories while also delving into some amazing facts about them which probably you may not be aware of before. So let’s hop into these 2-minutes short audio animal encyclopedias to know more about the members of our animal kingdom!

A land animal or terrestrial animal are those that lives on land. Listed below are some popular land animals that you ought to know about along with some of their fascinating characteristics.

1509930788,"Jalal-ud-din-Mohammad Akbar, also known as Akbar, was one of the most famous Mughal kings and he reigned India during the 16th century. Akbar, unlike other Mughal emperors, was keen to have talented people in his court irrespective of their religion. He had nine gems in his court and amongst them, Birbal was widely considered the most intelligent. A Brahmin by birth, Birbal’s original name was Mahesh Das and he met Akbar first time when he helped Akbar and his courtiers find the way back to their kingdom after having lost their way while on a hunting trip. Akbar and Birbal’s friendship lasted for 30 years before Birbal became a casualty of a war with North West tribes and it is said that Akbar went into a deep mourning for 2 days on hearing this and didn’t eat any food. 

Numerous Akbar Birbal stories from this time have been passed on from one generation to another in which Akbar will test Birbal’s skills by throwing him into tricky situations and Birbal had to use his wit to get out of them. 

Chimes Radio brings a collection of such bedtime stories for kids to enjoy. Each audio story while having a touch of fun also has a strong moral lesson for children.
